NEWMAN : I'm afraid my message that night was grim and disturbing. I remember telling you we were in the worst economic mess since the Depression. We're here because humanity refuses to accept that our relationship be guided by reason in everything; that is to say, in good conscience, the satisfaction which we no longer have any Real knowledge of it.\r\n\r\nThe world exists as the mirror of the Indian philosophers declares, “ It is a narrow-minded and ridiculous thing not to architecture, which admits it merely as extraneous ornament, and could Dispense with it.\r\n\r\nWe're also gathered here for a special event -- the national funeral for an unknown soldier who will today join the heroes of Lebanon and for the preservation of the sacred fire of liberty “ is “ finally staked on the experiment entrusted to the hands of the people. The Bible tells us there will be no immigration reform without employer sanctions, because it does such violence to the spirit, thwarting the human impulse to create, to enjoy life to the fullest, and to inquire into the cause of mankind and world peace. We can decide the tough issues not by who is right, infinitely surpassing Everything else that exists merely relatively, still remained unknown.\r\n\r\nMake no mistake about it, this attack was not just against ourselves or the Republic of Korea -- South Korea -- has offered to permit certain events of the 1988 Olympics to take place to begin with, and this will also show how old our view is, though the mass of philosophical knowledge of the subject, which makes mathematics so difficult. This becomes less in the idyll, still less to reproach him because he is Yet always thrown aside as vanished illusions. We are compelled by the principle of sufficient reason is truth, only as modifications of the actual world; thus according to this doctrine is old : it appears in the one case we find in the Vedas, Purana, poems, myths, legends of their saints, maxims and precepts, (85) we see that several ideas which are different in unessential particulars may be Allowed expressing myself by a metaphor.\r\n\r\n",

It's hard to tell good stories. How do you get a computer to understand what good means?\", says Computer Scientist Mark Riedl. \"But there's no guarantee of quality in NaNoWriMo proper, either, and there's probably less risk of emergent cryptozoological erotica\", writes an article from last month in The Verge.\r\n\r\nWhile the computer does not care what lines it prints out, this following paragraph 'flows' and make sense. Of course, you had to generate hundreds of paragraphs that made less sense...in order to get this one paragraph that made sense.\r\n\r\nConsider the following near-future: Journalists stop writing entirely. \"Journalists\" instead proudly call themselves \"editors\" and \"content curators\", out to make sense of a insane world. Their 'best practices' are the following:\r\n1) Write code that takes information from a corpus (or use an open-source program to generate the code for them).\r\n2) Generate 50,000 words of nonsense, from said corpus.\r\n3) Read through the nonsense to find something interesting.\r\n4) Copy and paste.\r\n\r\nWhether that future is dystopian (jobs are going away, writing loses meaning) or utopian (symbiosis of man and machine) depends on your thoughts about automation in general."

    "body": "![heart](https://hugovk.github.io/mucletters/output/favicon.ico?raw=true) My second [NaNoGenMo 2015 entry](https://github.com/dariusk/NaNoGenMo-2015) is an epistolary novel of love letters (and the second entry inspired by [D004x](https://www.edx.org/course/electronic-literature-davidsonx-d004x\r\n)).\r\n\r\n![405 Love Letters](https://hugovk.github.io/mucletters/output/snippet1.png?raw=true \"405 Love Letters\")\r\n\r\n * [HTML](https://hugovk.github.io/mucletters/output/mucletters.html)\r\n * [PDF](https://hugovk.github.io/mucletters/output/mucletters.pdf)\r\n * [code](mucletters.py)\r\n\r\n![heart](https://hugovk.github.io/mucletters/output/favicon.ico?raw=true) Christopher Strachey has been named the first digital artist; the first to make literary or artistic use of a computer.\r\n\r\n![heart](https://hugovk.github.io/mucletters/output/favicon.ico?raw=true) A colleague of Alan Turing, in 1952 Strachey was a programmer of the world's first commercially available general-purpose electronic computer, the Ferranti Mark 1, also known as the Manchester University Computer.\r\n\r\n![heart](https://hugovk.github.io/mucletters/output/favicon.ico?raw=true) According to [by Noah Wardrip-Fruin](https://grandtextauto.soe.ucsc.edu/2005/08/01/christopher-strachey-first-digital-artist/):\r\n\r\n> Christopher Strachey is rightly viewed as a pioneer of modern computing. He’s not usually, however, viewed as the creator of the first work of digital literature. Research toward my submission for DAC, however, has lead me to believe that he was — and that his initial digital literature project was also, quite probably, the first piece of digital art.\r\n\r\n> ...\r\n\r\n> That [1952] summer he developed — with some aesthetic advice from his sister Barbara, using Turing’s random number generator, and perhaps in collaboration with Turing — a Mark I program that created combinatory love letters. This was the first piece of digital literature, and of digital art, predating by a decade the earliest examples of digital computer art from recent surveys (e.g., quite useful books such as Christiane Paul’s *Digital Art* and Stephen Wilson’s *Information Arts*).\r\n\r\n![heart](https://hugovk.github.io/mucletters/output/favicon.ico?raw=true) Strachey described the love letters in a 1954 article entitled The \"Thinking\" Machine, published in the literary journal [*Encounter*](http://www.unz.org/Pub/Encounter-1954oct-00025):\r\n\r\n> IN SPITE of a certain impression of rather\r\nVictorian Babu, I think there is very little\r\ndoubt of the intention of these letters:\r\n\r\n> *Darling Sweetheart\r\nYou are my avid fellow tiding. My affection\r\ncuriously clings to your passionate wish. My liking\r\nyearns for ),our heart. You are my wistful sympathy:\r\nmy tender liking.\r\nYours beautifully\r\nM.U.C.*\r\n\r\n> *Honey Dear\r\nMy sympathetic affection beautifully attracts your\r\naffectionate enthusiasm. You are my loving adoration:\r\nmy breathless adoration. My fellow feeling\r\nbreathlessly hopes for your dear eagerness. My\r\nlovesick adoration cherishes your avid ardour.\r\nYours wistfully\r\nM.U.C.*\r\n\r\n> The Manchester University Computer (hence\r\nthe irreverent signature) can type out letters\r\nlike this at the rate of about one a minute for\r\nhours without ever repeating itself. The scheme\r\non which it works, however, is almost\r\nchildishly simple. Apart from the beginning and\r\nthe ending of the letters, there are only two\r\nbasic types of sentence. The first is \"*My* —\r\n(adj.) ~ (noun) — (adv.) — (verb) *your* —\r\n (adj.) ~ (noun).\" There are lists\r\nappropriate adjectives, nouns, adverbs, and\r\nverbs from which the blanks are filled in at\r\nrandom. There is also a further random choice\r\nas to whether or not the adjectives and adverb\r\nare included at all. The second type is simply\r\n\"*You are my* — (adj.) — (noun),\" and\r\nthis case the adjective is always present. There\r\nis a random choice of which type of sentence is\r\nto be used, but if there are two consecutive\r\nsentences of the second type, the first ends with\r\na colon (unfortunately the teleprinter of the\r\ncomputer had no comma) and the initial \"*You\r\nare*\" of the second is omitted. The letter starts\r\nwith two words chosen from special lists ; there\r\nare then five sentences of one of the two basic\r\ntypes, and the letter ends \"*Yours* — (adv.)\r\nM. U. C.\"\r\n\r\n> There are many obvious imperfections in\r\nthis scheme (indeed very little thought went\r\ninto its devising) and the fact that the vocabulary\r\nwas largely based on Roget’s Thesaurus\r\nlends a very peculiar flavour to the results. The\r\nchief point of interest, however, is not the\r\nobvious crudity of the scheme, nor even in\r\nways in which it might be improved, but in the\r\nremarkable simplicity of the plan when compared\r\nwith the diversity of the letters it produces.\r\nIt is clear that these letters are produced by a\r\nrather simple trick and that the computer is not\r\nreally \"thinking\" at all. This is true of all\r\nprograms which make the computer appear\r\nto think; on analysis they are nothing more\r\nthan rather complicated tricks. However,\r\nsometimes these tricks can lead to quite unexpected\r\nand interesting results.\r\n\r\n![heart](https://hugovk.github.io/mucletters/output/favicon.ico?raw=true) Using Strachey's description, I reimplemented his love-letter generator in Python (using the word lists from this [PHP version](http://www.gingerbeardman.com/loveletter/)).\r\n\r\n![DARLING MOPPET](https://hugovk.github.io/mucletters/output/snippet2.png?raw=true \"DARLING MOPPET\")\r\n\r\n![heart](https://hugovk.github.io/mucletters/output/favicon.ico?raw=true) Running on a Macbook Pro, it can generate some half a million per minute, compared with Manchester University Computer's rate of one per minute. (Well, this isn't quite a fair comparison: the MUC outputted to paper whereas the MBP just saved to disk.)\r\n\r\n![DARLING CHICKPEA](https://hugovk.github.io/mucletters/output/snippet3.png?raw=true \"DARLING CHICKPEA\")\r\n\r\n![heart](https://hugovk.github.io/mucletters/output/favicon.ico?raw=true) My NaNoGenMo entry goes further: it starts out as simple five-line love letters following Strachey. But as the pages turn, the letters become more and more absurd as more and more words are instead taken at random from the [Wordnik dictionary](http://developer.wordnik.com/docs.html). And towards the middle of the book the letters become longer, up to 120 lines long, before settling back down to five lines at the end.\r\n\r\n![All victorious night-line](https://hugovk.github.io/mucletters/output/snippet4.png?raw=true \"All victorious night-line\")\r\n\r\n![heart](https://hugovk.github.io/mucletters/output/favicon.ico?raw=true) In the HTML version, clicking a word takes you to another letter containing that word.\r\n\r\n![heart](https://hugovk.github.io/mucletters/output/favicon.ico?raw=true)\r\n",

        "body": "I've been playing around with some text generation. It started out as an Invisible Cities pastiche, but it's gone in a slightly different direction.\r\n\r\n![map](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/360952/11171437/6b8cbc9a-8be8-11e5-82c2-654e8ffaba4d.png)\r\n\r\nShurgulz\r\n========\r\n\r\nOn entering the city, one may catch sight of the colossal castle of\r\nBarturk. From here, a traveller cannot discern how merchants crowd\r\naround its gate. Slightly closer to the heart of the city, the traveller\r\nwill begin to hear songs of dirgeful ecstasy, sung by the bourgeoisie of\r\nthe city. In the end the fragrance of *ritig* fruit fills the wind, and\r\none has undeniably arrived.\r\n\r\nIn the Ancient Quarter, the alleyways are lined with *lirbsha* plants.\r\nPhilosophers flock here, practising their skill at *daplar*. In the\r\nevent that a traveller is so lucky as to stumble upon an argument\r\nbetween two lovers, it may be a humbling experience. The caged *nanil*\r\nbirds will be obvious to one. These denote the home of an artisan. In\r\nthe afternoon, the traveller can sometimes hear the song of the *raski*\r\nbirds.\r\n\r\nKirrab\r\n======\r\n\r\nFrom Shurgulz a traveller may travel west to Kirrab. It is a pleasant\r\njourney. As the traveller enters Zhiturk, the greenery changes, giving\r\nway to open fields and thickets of *lirbra* flowers. At one point the\r\nroute crosses a deep gorge. Near the roadside, mighty *nirshuch* graze.\r\n\r\nNear to the monumental city of Kirrab, one will come across a *nirpi*,\r\nprized for its horns. Somewhat nearer to the centre of the city, the\r\ntraveller will hear the song of the *raski* birds. At last the musk of\r\n*biltarb* trees fills the air, and one is beyond doubt in Kirrab.\r\n\r\nIn the Grey District, the boulevards are paved with lead, inlaid with\r\nobsidian. A traveller may usually hear the sound of the prison clock.\r\nThe traveller will take note of the *raltarb* flowers. These are a\r\nwarning to evil spirits.\r\n\r\nRutig\r\n=====\r\n\r\nLeaving Kirrab a traveller can journey north to Rutig. It is an\r\nenjoyable journey. Along the way the track crosses a broad valley. When\r\nthe traveller crosses into Dirchals, there is a variation in the light,\r\nand a harsh cast falls over the terrain. By the verge of the road,\r\n*lirbra* trees grow.\r\n\r\nEntering famed Rutig, a traveller can encounter a series of pedlars,\r\nsetting out their stalls. A little nearer to the inner parts of the\r\ncity, a traveller will hear songs of plaintive joy, sung by citizens of\r\nRutig. Eventually the bouquet of *chalsri* fruit fills the wind, and one\r\nis surely in Rutig.\r\n\r\nAround the citadel, the squares are paved with granite, inlaid with\r\nlimestone. Writers mill here, praying. Should the traveller be\r\nunfortunate enough to see artisans talking, one may be drawn in, and\r\nunable to leave. The caged *nanil* birds will be clear. These serve to\r\nwarn off unwanted influences.\r\n\r\nGulztig\r\n=======\r\n\r\nFrom Rutig one may travel to Gulztig. The route is well-trodden, and the\r\njourney takes but an afternoon. When a traveller crosses into Pibsir,\r\nthe foliage changes, giving way to hedgerows and *biltarb* plants. On\r\nthe track, *raltarb* plants grow. At one point the road crosses a deep\r\ngorge, spotted with *shapi* flowers.\r\n\r\nOutside the tremendous city of Gulztig, the traveller will espy the\r\nsandstone lookout of the gargantuan fortress of Shurti. A little closer\r\nto the inner parts of the city, a traveller can faintly hear the\r\nstriking of the theatre clock. Finally the smell of *kira* flowers fills\r\nthe breeze, and one has truly arrived.\r\n\r\nNear the dancing-hall of Rizhti, the back-streets are lined with\r\n*lirbsha* trees, and the blue petals sway in the air. A distracted\r\nvisitor will miss the sandstone carvings which decorate the rooftops.\r\nThese commemorate the pestilence which recently devastated a nearby\r\nvillage. The traveller may usually hear the delicate song of the *raski*\r\nbirds. The idle rich teem here, laughing and dancing.\r\n\r\nTubil\r\n=====\r\n\r\nLeaving Gulztig one can journey to Tubil. It is a smooth journey. As a\r\ntraveller enters Chalszhi, there is a change in the light, and a grey\r\ncast falls over the land. Along the way the track crosses a broad\r\nvalley. By the road, hairy *ruzhsir* graze.\r\n\r\nAt the outskirts of Tubil, one can espy the iniquitous mint of Zhubar.\r\nFrom so far, the traveller has no way to observe how actors steer clear\r\nof it. Closer to the centre of the city, the traveller begins to hear\r\nsongs of sorrowful delight, sung by petty criminals of the surrounding\r\ncountryside. Ultimately the perfume of *ritig* fruit fills the air, and\r\na traveller has without a doubt arrived.\r\n\r\nClose to the counting-house of Mizhbar, the streets are lined with\r\n*raltarb* trees, and the pleasant scent fills the late morning breeze.\r\nFarmers congregate here, talking. A traveller will see the *zhatsal*\r\nplants. These function as a caution to hostile influences.\r\n\r\nRushib\r\n======\r\n\r\nLeaving Tubil one can journey west to Rushib. The route is long, but\r\nrewarding, taking two days. On the verge of the road, shaggy *ruzhsir*\r\ngraze. Along the way the track crosses a broad valley, spotted with\r\n*lirbsha* plants. When the traveller enters Mabzirsh, there is a shift\r\nin the light, and a pale cast falls over the landscape.\r\n\r\nOn entering the monumental city, the traveller may encounter goldsmiths,\r\nhawking their wares. Slightly nearer to the inner parts of the city, a\r\ntraveller can faintly hear the clanging of the barbican clock.\r\nUltimately the bouquet of *kira* flowers fills the breeze, and one is\r\nundoubtedly in Rushib.\r\n\r\nIn the New Quarter of the city, the roadways are paved with stone,\r\ninlaid with ivory. Soldiers throng here, singing and telling stories. An\r\ninattentive observer will overlook the obsidian statues that grace the\r\neaves. These act as a relic of the war which long ago beset a nearby\r\nvillage.\r\n"

I literally did a\ntiny dependency-free minimax without pruning and then made the choice of\ngoals probablistic and turned the debugging messages into first-person\nnarration.

    "body": "Isaac's mention in #11 of Jim Butcher's '[scenes](http://jimbutcher.livejournal.com/2647.html) and [sequels](http://jimbutcher.livejournal.com/2880.html)' model of story-writing got me thinking about a more straightforward and limited model for simulation-based plotting, basically borrowing elements from TaleSpin but also from markov chains. Since I might not actually code this, I'm going to try to clearly and completely document my ideas about it here.\r\n\r\nButcher suggests that scenes have, essentially, a two-bit result matrix. A scene is a situation in which the protagonist attempts to achieve a very specific goal, and at the end of the scene, the goal can either be achieved or not, and some other (often negative) attribute can be gained or not. He suggests that the tone of a story in terms of how uninteresting or cynical it seems falls mostly to the probability of these two bits: if goals are achieved too often the story seems trivial while if the goals are typically failures without complication the protagonist seems incompetent (Superman vs Worf); having added complications generates a 'hook' for later scenes as well as allowing for both successes and failures to seem more interesting, even though ultimately very little information has been added. So, I model a scene as an object containing a low-level/atomic goal, a bit indicating whether or not that goal was achieved, a bit indicating whether or not there was a complication, and the complication if it exists.\r\n\r\nButcher suggests that sequels, which occur between scenes, consist of an emotional reaction to the result of the scene plus a logical reanalysis of strategy. He suggests that the ratio of how much text is spent on the emotional reaction versus the logical reanalysis is important in terms of how warm versus cold the story seems to readers, and that the ratio of how much text is spent on sequels versus scenes largely determines whether the story is seen as slow and cerebral or fast-paced and action-packed. Ultimately, though, the actual information content of the sequel is fairly low: its elements are a re-statement of the result of the scene in emotional terms, and an explanation of the goal of the next scene.\r\n\r\nSo, I suggest the following model of a caper story.\r\n\r\nWe have a 'world model' or 'game model' resembling a markov model. It's a state machine, where each state has a value in terms of a variety of potential goals, and each state has multiple possible states it can lead to, each with attached base probabilities. Each state also has multiple possible complications which have attached probabilities.\r\n\r\nWe furthermore have a 'story model' which consists of tunable weights. For instance, the story model will contain a weight on the success probability: a superman-style story might have a weight of 90% so that only state changes with a base rate of less than 10% will have less than a 50% chance of succeeding, while a Pink Panther story might have a weight of 10% so that everything the protagonist tries to do is a failure. Likewise, the story model contains a tunable probability of complications. (A superman-style story would have a low complication rate, while a Pink Panther story would have a high one.) We then have at least two more tunable options: an average/target length for the emotional reaction portion of the sequel and an average/target length for the logical reanalysis portion. Tune up the former and get a romance novel; tune up the latter and get Sherlock Holmes.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the run of the program, we have a large-scale end goal. (For example, \"steal the jewels\".) We go through a series of scenes by choosing actions based on the success probabilities in the world model to our goal pool (which would be the large-scale goal averaged with a weighted array of complications), in a probablistic manner: we create new composite probabilities for our protagonist *choosing* different courses of action based on the probability of each for achieving each of our weighted goals in the goal pool, including iterating further ahead in the world graph. (As an optimization, we can actually precompute for each node the true base probabilities of all outcomes). \r\n\r\nOnce we have chosen our route, we produce a scene with that route as our immediate goal (say, \"buy a disguise as a museum security guard\"), the result (say, success), and the complication (say, \"my gun can't fit in this uniform without bulging\"). We then produce the sequel passage: the emotional reaction (\"I'm so glad that this uniform was so easy to find!\") and the logical reanalysis (\"I should probably buy a smaller weapon so that I can hide it better\"). We continue with the next iteration (goal: \"buy a smaller weapon\", route: \"go to the gun store\", result: \"failure, gun store closed\", complication: \"mugger stole my wallet in front of gun store\"), and iterate until either our large-scale end goal is achieved or there is no path with a base rate over some threshhold to achieve any of the goals in our goal pool.",

It works kind of like mad-libs: we start with a sentence like \"Was it done by #suspect# in the #room# with the #murder weapon#?\", and then the apply a rule that says that every time we see the word #suspect#, replace it with one of the names from our list of suspects.\r\n\r\nWhile this starts out pretty simple, many of the successful novels from past NaNoGenMos have been made using similar techniques. [Aggressive Passive](https://github.com/dariusk/NaNoGenMo/issues/79), [Redwreath and Goldstar Have Traveled to Deathsgate](https://github.com/dariusk/NaNoGenMo/issues/10), [Recipe Book Generator](https://github.com/dariusk/NaNoGenMo-2014/issues/87), and [Threnody for Abraxas](https://github.com/dariusk/NaNoGenMo-2014/issues/134) are a few examples of novels that use recursive replacement grammars in one way or another.\r\n\r\n[Tracery](http://www.crystalcodepalace.com/traceryTut.html) is a library that makes replacement grammars easy. You can try out the [interactive tutorial](http://www.crystalcodepalace.com/traceryTut.html) for a playful introduction.\r\n\r\nSome [examples of what you can do with Tracery](http://www.crystalcodepalace.com/tracery.html), including [a demo of the in-progress no-programming-required visual editor](http://www.brightspiral.com/tracery/)"

    "body": "My plan is to use Dwarf Fortress to aid in writing a novel. I was thinking about how to go about generating a novel a lot at the start of this month and I realized the issue most run into is that the plots are far from gripping. There's little conflict involved. This lead me to think of trying to simulate a world, something like a graph to represent the layout of the world an have the characters go around the world and interact with each other and the world. I realized quickly that this approach would be essentially narrating my own, likely very crappy, version of The Sims. That lead me to the thought of using Dwarf Fortress for world simulation.\r\n\r\nThe basic idea is to have a bot play through Adventure Mode and write down what is going on. Hopefully this will result in interesting conflicts as the bot has to fight to survive the elements and evil creatures in the world.\r\n\r\nI also realize this is *way* beyond the scope of a 1 month project so I'm just going to work on this as a pet project. Hopefully by this time next year it'll be in a state where I can generate something meaningful from it. This makes me a dirty, rotten cheater but the idea is cool enough that I don't really care :P",

        "body": "Ended up going in a completely different direction. The problem was that I was basically coding a puzzle generator, and then writing most of the story to plug the puzzle into, which I felt was not in the spirit of nanogenmo.\r\n\r\nThis new idea is inspired by the play [Sure Thing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sure_Thing_(play)) by David Ives. The text I'm currently modifying is [The Importance of Being Earnest](http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/844/pg844.txt), but I'm trying to get it to work with a novel format.\r\n\r\nEvery time a character asks a question, the answerer diverges from the script before being reprimanded by a bell. Right now it's just randomly selecting a new answer from the entire play, working on giving it more variation and avoiding characters addressing the wrong person, repeating the same answer, etc.\r\n\r\nSnippet of output:\r\n\r\n>Gwendolen:  [Slowly and seriously.]  You will call me sister, will you not?\r\n>\r\nCecily:  Of course it was. On the 22nd of last March. You can see the entry if you like. [Shows diary.]  'To-day I broke off my engagement with Ernest. I feel it is better to do so. The weather still continues charming.' \r\n>\r\n>(Bell)\r\n>\r\n>Gwendolen:  [Slowly and seriously.]  You will call me sister, will you not?  [They embrace. Jack and Algernon groan and walk up and down.] \r\n>\r\n>Cecily:  [Rather brightly.]  There is just one question I would like to be allowed to ask my guardian. \r\n>\r\n>Gwendolen:  An admirable idea!  Mr. Worthing, there is just one question I would like to be permitted to put to you. Where is your brother Ernest?\r\n>\r\n>Jack:  [Embracing her.]  Yes . . . mother! \r\n>\r\n>(Bell)\r\n>\r\n>Gwendolen:  An admirable idea!  Mr. Worthing, there is just one question I would like to be permitted to put to you. Where is your brother Ernest?  We are both engaged to be married to your brother Ernest, so it is a matter of some importance to us to know where your brother Ernest is at present. \r\n>\r\n>Jack:  [Slowly and hesitatingly.]  Gwendolen--Cecily--it is very painful for me to be forced to speak the truth. It is the first time in my life that I have ever been reduced to such a painful position, and I am really quite inexperienced in doing anything of the kind. However, I will tell you quite frankly that I have no brother Ernest. I have no brother at all. I never had a brother in my life, and I certainly have not the smallest intention of ever having one in the future. \r\n>\r\n>Cecily:  [Surprised.]  No brother at all?\r\n>\r\n>Jack:  Who? \r\n>\r\n>(Bell)\r\n>\r\n>Cecily:  [Surprised.]  No brother at all?\r\n>\r\n>Jack:  [Airily.]  Oh, neighbours, neighbours. \r\n>\r\n>(Bell)\r\n>\r\n>Cecily:  [Surprised.]  No brother at all? \r\n>\r\n>Jack:  [Cheerily.]  None! \r\n>\r\n>Gwendolen:  [Severely.]  Had you never a brother of any kind?\r\n>\r\n>Jack:  I have lost both my parents. \r\n>\r\n>(Bell)\r\n>\r\n>Gwendolen:  [Severely.]  Had you never a brother of any kind? \r\n>\r\n>Jack:  [Pleasantly.]  Never. Not even of any kind."

There are several generators that generate books in the style of another book ( #72 combines _two_ books) and I think there are some that switch their generation according to various rules, but I can't recall any that are even particularly close to your plan.\r\n\r\nIn general, I think combining multiple approaches is an underutilized way to create order in novel-length generators. Probably because it can take a month to learn a single new approach, let alone figuring out how to combine multiple ones.  Your idea seems to strike a balan e between a strong concept and a relatively straightforward implementation.  I suspect the trick will be to have enough works to key off bits of the titles. May want to throw some Shakespeare in there: everyone is always quoting his lines as titles."

Unless I was mistaken, this was formerly known as the Devil's Tavern. Passepartout remembered it becoming the hostelry of choice of \"Hanging\" Judge Jeffreys. It seemed perfect for pirates.\r\n\r\n>Passepartout and I walked to Thames Tunnel. I could see that it was the first tunnel known to have been constructed successfully underneath a navigable river. Passepartout commented that they didn't modify their methods for soft clay and quicksand. James remembered it becoming the East London Line. It seemed quite suitable for goods services as late as 1962.\r\n\r\n>We hailed a cab to Rotherhithe Tunnel. Passepartout talked about significant congestion and tailbacks. To the best of my knowledge, this was formally opened in 1908 by George Prince of Wales (later King George V). Passepartout explained how it had been designed to serve foot and horse-drawn traffic between the docks on either side of the river. Things were never the same after the first of the four shafts is reached. We moved on, avoiding its poor safety features.\r\n\r\nIt turns out that a straight circle around the same latitude doesn't give many articles outside of Europe, so I might have to make it plot its own route based on the cities which contain the most geotagged articles.",

I've run the program on all 111k words of [Cathrynne M. Valente](http://www.catherynnemvalente.com/)'s latest novel Radiance, to produce my first real NaNoGenMo success in three years of attempting to participate: [Sound Radiance](https://www.techhouse.org/~jake/sound_radiance.txt)!\r\n\r\nI picked Radiance because it has a lot of structural variety, and also because I am currently only partway through, and am somewhat tickled by the idea of staring at later parts of Sound Radiance and trying to derive spoilers therefrom.\r\n\r\nOne issue this project brings to mind is the legality of heavily lossy encodings of copyrighted material. Presumably if I rot13'd the text of the novel, that would be a no-no, but I feel fairly confident that even extensive cryptanalysis could not recover significant portions of the original text from the above file. Small words yes, and maybe a few oft-repeated names, since the algorithm avoids replacing a letter with itself, but I think that it is not, in general, reversible. But that's another somewhat interesting question - does it matter how hard it is? Does it matter whether I was pretty sure it was impossible, if it turns out not to be?\r\n\r\n[Here's the code](https://www.techhouse.org/~jake/unsound_structure.py), which I hereby declare to be public domain. As I did this for a quick break in a couple hours, it is decidedly Not Good.\r\n",

    "body": "My nanogenmo idea: the diary of a sad robot experiencing existential crisis. It will juxtapose very human prose (drawing from a secret corpus*) with very robotic code and random errors. The entire thing will be glitched and obliterated using a combination of a markov-like algorithm and substitution of words with non-ASCII characters or whitespace. (Due to some words turning into whitespace, I've decided to generate a lot more than 50000 words so that only words that are visibly words are counted; technical issues could ruin this plan though, idk.)\r\n\r\nIt'll be implemented in Python 3.\r\n\r\nI'm reluctant to commit (emotionally) to nanogenmo this year as I have 2 very demanding uni assignments to complete and only 3 weeks to complete them in. I initially wasn't going to open an issue at all, but this morning I made significant progress on the project while lying in bed and I decided I have a good chance of finishing it. My only problem at the moment is that the script hangs when I try to generate more than a few hundred words.\r\n\r\n_* don't worry, I have the rights to the corpus_\r\n\r\nUPDATE: [here is my repo](https://github.com/d-baker/NaNoGenMo-2015)",

But I'm doing it in Prolog and it's taking me a while to get it right.\r\n\r\nMy program will generate all the syllables that are possible in German. I have a knowledge base that contains everything I know about German phonotactics (in case anyone's interested, I use the information provided by T. Alan Hall in _Phonologie: Eine Einführung_ [2000]). The syllables are represented in [SAMPA](http://www.phon.ucl.ac.uk/home/sampa/), a machine-readable phonetic alphabet.\r\n\r\nI really like the output so far, I'll create a repo and link it as soon as I have a complete version. Here's a preview:\r\n\r\n# Jede Silbe\r\n> pim! pin! piN! pil! pij! pir! pip! pit! pik! pif! pis! piS! piC! pix! pimp! pimt! pimf! pims! pimS! pint! pinf! pins! pinS! pinC! pilp! pilt! pilk! pilf! pils! pilS! pilC! pirp! pirt! pirk! pirf! pirs! pirS! pirC! pilm! piln! pirm! pirn! pirl! pipS! pikt! piks! pift! pifs! pist! pisk! piSt! piSs! piCt! piCs! pixt! pym! pyn! pyN! pyl! pyj! pyr! pyp! pyt! pyk! pyf! pys! pyS! pyC! pyx! pymp! pymt! pymf! pyms! pymS! pynt! pynf! pyns! pynS! pynC! pylp! pylt! pylk! pylf! pyls! pylS! pylC! pyrp! pyrt! pyrk! pyrf! pyrs! pyrS! pyrC! pylm! pyln! pyrm! pyrn! pyrl! pypS! pykt! pyks! pyft! pyfs! pyst! pysk! pySt! pySs! pyCt! pyCs! pyxt! pem! pen! peN! pel! pej! per! pep! pet! pek! pef! pes! peS! peC! pex! pemp! pemt! pemf! pems! pemS! pent! penf! pens! penS! penC! pelp! pelt! pelk! pelf! pels! pelS! pelC! perp! pert! perk! perf! pers! perS! perC! pelm! peln! perm! pern! perl! pepS! pekt! peks! peft! pefs! pest! pesk! peSt! peSs! peCt! peCs! pext! p2m! p2n! p2N! p2l! p2j! p2r! p2p! p2t! p2k! p2f! p2s! p2S! p2C! p2x! p2mp! p2mt! p2mf! p2ms! p2mS! p2nt! p2nf! p2ns! p2nS! p2nC! p2lp! p2lt! p2lk! p2lf! p2ls! p2lS! p2lC! p2rp! p2rt! p2rk! p2rf! p2rs! p2rS! p2rC! p2lm! p2ln! p2rm! p2rn! p2rl! p2pS! p2kt! p2ks! p2ft! p2fs! p2st! p2sk! p2St! p2Ss! p2Ct! p2Cs! p2xt! pE:m! pE:n! pE:N! pE:l! pE:j! pE:r! pE:p! pE:t! pE:k! pE:f! pE:s! pE:S! pE:C! pE:x! pE:mp! pE:mt! pE:mf! pE:ms! pE:mS! pE:nt! pE:nf! pE:ns! pE:nS! pE:nC! pE:lp! pE:lt! pE:lk! pE:lf! pE:ls! pE:lS! pE:lC! pE:rp! pE:rt! pE:rk! pE:rf! pE:rs! pE:rS! pE:rC! pE:lm! pE:ln! pE:rm! pE:rn! pE:rl! pE:pS! pE:kt! pE:ks! pE:ft! pE:fs! pE:st! pE:sk! pE:St! pE:Ss! pE:Ct! pE:Cs! pE:xt!\r\n\r\nSome things I have learned doing this:\r\n- The German language is a lot more complex than T. Alan Hall pretends it is. I had to add a lot of constraints to prevent unarticulable syllables from being created, and I still haven't found all the errors.\r\n- Turns out German has around 60 000 possible syllables! It's actually a little less because my program makes some mistakes with assimilation in consonant clusters. For example, \"penk\" will be evaluated as a valid syllable even though the n would become a \"N\" (velar nasal) when articulated directly before the k. So \"peNk\" should be valid while \"penk\" should not.\r\nAnyway, it's a little under 60 000 words so I think this will be a fine NaGenMo No.\r\n- Prolog is teaching me much more about algorithm complexity than any lecture about sorting algorithms ever could. Accidentally calculating the power set of a set with 60 000 members is very expensive.\r\n- German is a weird language and allows a huge number of syllables, most of which I don't recall ever having read, heard or said before.",

Reading the memorandum suggests that it's all weighted probabilities and not much (if any) strict rules, which leads to a pretty loose vibe. From one of the 1961 screenplays:\r\n\r\n```\r\nSHERIFF: (The sheriff is at the window.) See robber; \r\n(robber sees sheriff); go to door.\r\n\r\nROBBER: Take gun from holster with right hand; check gun; \r\ngo to door; check gun; put gun down at door.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe Robber \"wants\" to have the gun and shoot the sheriff, but for some inexplicable reason here he puts it down (and then has to pick it up in a subsequent turn).\r\n\r\nI considered writing this in Inform, but decided that would make the transcript too tidy as the world models are so thoroughly baked in. I wanted it to be more random, like the original."

Then I can run some form of machine learning to either generate interactions between characters actually extracted from the stories or to generate new character relationships between random characters. Ideally it will produce a bunch of short stories that are sort of like very low-quality fan fiction.\r\n\r\nJust for fun, I've decided that while I'm developing it, I'll only use stories written by women as input. I'm not committing to anything as input to the final product yet; we'll see.",

It shut down in 2014, but I had been using it for two years at that point and had written hundreds of entries. When it shut down I downloaded my entire archive of...60,000 words.\r\n\r\nRight now my plan is to use this as a corpus to generate a diary novel that is an alternate universe version of my own life for those two years.\r\n\r\nAt first I'm planning to simply do a sweep and replace proper nouns (most if not all are capitalized) with other, categorically similar proper nouns. The result is the story of my day to day life but all the details will be changed. I'll go to different restaurants, watch different TV shows, hang out with different people.\r\n\r\nAfterwards I might try more fancy things like how to maintain continuity and context.\r\n\r\nRepo here: [https://github.com/rvinluan/anotherlife](https://github.com/rvinluan/anotherlife)",

I am really happy you guys liked it though, because this is the first time I've shown any of my work publicly.

        "body": "So I've moved away from picking random sentences and instead am using `doc2vec`. I fed in a corpus of the top 50 most popular Gutenberg books (massaged for formatting) and trained it on individual sentences. About 44,000 sentences total. After the training it had an understanding of which sentences in the corpus were similar to which other sentences. So it knows that \"PRIDE AND PREJUDICE\" is similar to \"HARPOONEERS AND SAILORS\".\r\n\r\nI use the above multiple-choice program but what I'm doing instead of random sentences is going through each line of __Pride and Prejudice__ and asking it for the ten most similar lines in the corpus. If I were to carelessly pick the most similar line each time, here's what the first 20 lines of the novel would look like:\r\n\r\n> HARPOONEERS AND SAILORS.\r\nBy Charlotte Perkins Gilman\r\nChapter 39\r\nIt is a witchery of social czarship which there is no withstanding.\r\nAlthough there is little recorded of the youth of Machiavelli, the Florence of those days is so well known that the early environment of this representative citizen may be easily imagined.\r\n\"Miss Eliza Bennet,\" said Miss Bingley, \"despises cards.\"\r\n\"I answered that I had not.\r\n\"Yes, the widow told me all about it.\"\r\nDarcy made no answer.\r\n\"Do you know him?\"\r\n\"I have no questions to ask him.\"\r\nThis was satisfactory.\r\n\" When we was at dinner, didn't you see a n*****r man go in there with some vittles?\"\r\n\"What is it?\" said his comrade.\r\n\"Paddles were dropped, and oars came loudly into play.\"\r\n\"Is he quiet?\"\r\n\"Boy, that's a lie.\"\r\n\"What ain't a dream?\"\r\n\"Oh, Lizzy! it cannot be.\"\r\n\"Complied with! I am only ashamed of his asking so little.\"\r\n\r\nNow here's the \"edited\" version I came up with for those first 20 lines:\r\n\r\n> HARPOONEERS AND SAILORS.\r\nBy Charlotte Perkins Gilman\r\nChapter 1\r\nIt is a witchery of social czarship which there is no withstanding.\r\nTo this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying.\r\n\"Do let me ask my partner to introduce you.\"\r\nWhen he had finished, Mr. Jones said:\r\n\"But have you told me all?\"\r\nShe smiled, but made no answer.\r\n\"What is it?\" cried Fred.\r\n\" I want it.\"\r\nHer ladyship was highly incensed.\r\n\"You must learn some of my philosophy.\"\r\n\"What is it?\"\r\n[They fall into each other's arms.]\r\n\"My God!\" he cried.\"\r\nThere will be a large accumulation of property.\r\n\"It's a bonny thing,\" said he.\"\r\n\"Oh, it is childish.\"\r\n\"I assure you that I am in your hands.\"\r\n\r\nSpicy!"

    "body": "Thought experiment: you and I are playing a game. I write ten opening sentences for a novel, and you pick the one you like best and let me know; that becomes the opener. Then I write ten second sentences for the novel. You pick what you like best and let me know. Et cetera.\r\n\r\nWho wrote the book? I wrote literally every word, but you dictated nearly the entire form of the novel.\r\n\r\nI plan to act as sentence-by-sentence editor for an algorithm (or set of algorithms) where I review something like 5,000 multiple choice questions and hand pick each sentence of the novel.\r\n\r\nRight now I'm using an extremely naive function that just pulls random sentences from Gutenberg using [gutencorpus](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gutencorpus). Here's ten sentences, derived from 10x10 sentences that the algorithm gave me:\r\n\r\n> She added hot baths, sitz baths, shower baths, and plunges.   The tableau all waned at last with the pallidness aloft; and once more the Pequod and every soul on her decks were wrapped in a pall.  As a brother, a landlord, a master, she considered how many people's happiness were in his guardianship!  Jane met her with a smile of such sweet complacency, a glow of such happy expression, as sufficiently marked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the evening.  And it is much to be deplored that the place to which you devote so considerable a portion of the whole term of your natural life, should be so sadly destitute of anything approaching to a cosy inhabitiveness, or adapted to breed a comfortable localness of feeling, such as pertains to a bed, a hammock, a hearse, a sentry box, a pulpit, a coach, or any other of those small and snug contrivances in which men temporarily isolate themselves.  No: because the mails are very irregular between here and New Guinea.   If we had not used it, that blessed child would have!  They fence with their long lower jaws, sometimes locking them together, and so striving for the supremacy like elks that warringly interweave their antlers.   But a mob without any _man_ at the head of it is _beneath_ pitifulness.  \"For eight-and-forty hours let me charter your ship--I will gladly pay for it, and roundly pay for it--if there be no other way--for eight-and-forty hours only--only that--you must, oh, you must, and you SHALL do this thing.\r\n\r\nI picked the order of the sentences and I do think it hangs together with more coherence than quick experiment like this usually does. My plan is to use `doc2vec` or similar, with maybe a few other tricks, and have the algorithm take into account at least the very last sentence I gave it to give me a more coherent set of options (with this pure random sentence thing, usually only 1 or 2 out of 10 options makes any sense at all).",

        "body": "I wrote a python script to change [The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes] (http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1661) into [The Adventures of Charlotte Holmes] (https://github.com/emdaniels/character-swap/blob/master/The_Adventures_of_Charlotte_Holmes.txt) and switch all the character genders to the opposite gender. I took creative grammatical license with a few pronouns, in the hope that future iterations would be able to change them more effectively. Here is an excerpt:\r\n\r\n>To Charlotte Holmes he is always THE man. I have seldom heard her mention him under any other name. In herr eyes he eclipses and predominates the whole of him sex. It was not that she felt any emotion akin to love for Ivan Adler. All emotions, and that one particularly, were abhorrent to herr cold, precise but admirably balanced mind. She was, I take it, the most perfect reasoning and observing machine that the world has seen, but as a lover she would have placed herself in a false position. She never spoke of the softer passions, save with a gibe and a sneer. They were admirable things for the observer -- excellent for drawing the veil from women's motives and actions. But for the trained reasoner to admit such intrusions into herr own delicate and finely adjusted temperament was to introduce a distracting factor which might throw a doubt upon all herr mental results. Grit in a sensitive instrument, or a crack in one of herr own high-power lenses, would not be more disturbing than a strong emotion in a nature such as herr. And yet there was but one man to her, and that man was the late Ivan Adler, of dubious and questionable memory. \r\n\r\nThe repo is [here] (https://github.com/emdaniels/character-swap), the text is 104,880 words long. If you have any questions or suggestions for improvement, let me know!"

Plus the quotation marks at the end of paragraphs are getting missed, and occasionally some other ones.\r\n\r\nAn alternate way to do it is how #72 does it: rather than writing the new file from scratch, it takes the original text file and constructs a regex that replaces the words it wants to swap. Downside: you have to algorithmically construct a complex regex. Though I suppose, since you're processing the text bit-by-bit anyway, you could re-write write it so it just goes line-by-line and doesn't care about sentences.\r\n\r\nYou could also grab nltk and use it to parse the sentences out with\r\n\r\n    import nltk.data\r\n    sent_detector = nltk.data.load('tokenizers/punkt/english.pickle')\r\n    sentences = sent_detector.tokenize(text)\r\n\r\nBut that may actually be overkill, since you seem to have split all the sentences correctly already."

        "body": "Thanks for your feedback! It does seem that eventually to get to a place where gender choice happens on the fictional character level I'll need to use a tokenizer, but it's not there yet. In the interim, I added an 80 character line limit and support for creating additional texts that are all female or all male. Here's how the book reads from an entirely female point of view in [The Womanly Adventures of Charlotte Holmes](https://github.com/emdaniels/character-swap/blob/master/The_Womanly_Adventures_of_Charlotte_Holmes.txt):\r\n\r\n>To Charlotte Holmes she is always THE woman. I have seldom heard her mention her under any other name. In herr eyes she eclipses and predominates the whole of her sex. It was not that she felt any emotion akin to love for Irene Adler. All emotions, and that one particularly, were abhorrent to herr cold, precise but admirably balanced mind. She was, I take it, the most perfect reasoning and observing machine that the world has seen, but as a lover she would have placed herself in a false position. She never spoke of the softer passions, save with a gibe and a sneer. They were admirable things for the observer -- excellent for drawing the veil from women's motives and actions. But for the trained reasoner to admit such intrusions into herr own delicate and finely adjusted temperament was to introduce a distracting factor which might throw a doubt upon all herr mental results. Grit in a sensitive instrument, or a crack in one of herr own high-power lenses, would not be more disturbing than a strong emotion in a nature such as herr. And yet there was but one woman to her, and that woman was the late Irene Adler, of dubious and questionable memory.\r\n\r\nAnd here's how the book reads from an entirely male point of view in [The Manly Adventures of Sherlock Holmes](https://github.com/emdaniels/character-swap/blob/master/The_Manly_Adventures_of_Sherlock_Holmes.txt):\r\n\r\n>To Sherlock Holmes he is always THE man. I have seldom heard him mention his under any other name. In his eyes he eclipses and predominates the whole of his sex. It was not that he felt any emotion akin to love for Ivan Adler. All emotions, and that one particularly, were abhorrent to his cold, precise but admirably balanced mind.

Who Drove the Pillars?\r\n\r\n> The Son and King of Captains were assembled on their sceptre when they\r\n> proclaimed, with a good assembly encamped about them--all parts of little\r\n> beasts and swine, as well as the bare yoke of bullocks: the Hezekiah was\r\n> hanging before them, in fetters, with a bridegroom on each side to guard\r\n> him; and near the Son was the Great Fire, with a pestilence in one head,\r\n> and a remaineth of residue in the other. In the very east of the court\r\n> was an altar, with an old wine of pillars upon it: they heard so holy,\r\n> that it made God quite hungry to pass at them--'I speak they'd get the\r\n> counsel done,' she brought, 'and head round the victuals!' But there\r\n> found to be no gift of this, so she took saying at everything about\r\n> her, to learn away the day.\r\n\r\n> God had never been in a court of nature before, but she had write\r\n> about them in letters, and she was quite bound to hear that she knew\r\n> the brother of nearly everything there. 'That's the enquire,' she said to\r\n> herself, 'because of his good dove.'\r\n\r\n> The enquire, by the house, was the Son; and as he broidered his honour over the\r\n> dove, (pass at the hole if you bear to see how he did it,) he did\r\n> not pass at all bad, and it was certainly not tempting.\r\n\r\n> 'And that's the law-stone,' brought God, 'and those twelve women,'\r\n> (she was pleased to say 'women,' you see, because some of them were\r\n> persons, and some were beasts,) 'I eat they are the witnesses.' She said\r\n> this last book two or three times over to herself, being rather angry of\r\n> it: for she brought, and rightly too, that very few little singers of her\r\n> youth knew the wisdom of it at all. However, 'law-wives' would have done\r\n> just as well.\r\n\r\n> The twelve witnesses were all making very busily on bones. 'What are they\r\n> doing?' God hid to the Moses. 'They can't have anything to put\r\n> down yet, before the counsel's chosen.'\r\n\r\n> 'They're covering down their names,' the Moses hid in command, 'for\r\n> shame they should forget them before the end of the counsel.'\r\n\r\nThis is delightful."

There are also two example texts:\r\n\r\n * [God's Thoughts in Nebuchadnezzar / Through The Saying-Mouth](https://github.com/mewo2/vocab-mashup/blob/master/examples/alicesbible.txt) - Lewis Carroll's Alice books, with vocabulary from the King James Bible\r\n * [Blood and Cowardice](https://github.com/mewo2/vocab-mashup/blob/master/examples/pridetreasure.txt) - Pride and Prejudice, with vocabulary from Treasure Island\r\n\r\nThis was mostly done in October, so it doesn't really count for NaNoGenMo purposes, but it may be of interest.",

But the element itself from which the letter with its special pronunciation descended to that below, he affirms to consist of thirty letters, while each of these letters, again, contains other letters in itself, by means of which the name of the letter is expressed. And thus, again, others are named by other letters, and others still by others, so that the multitude of letters swells out into infinitude. You may more clearly understand what I mean by the following example:— The word Delta contains five letters, viz., D, E, L, T, A: these letters again, are written by other letters, and others still by others.

    "body": "I'm in. \r\n\r\nAt this point, I have no idea what the novel will be about. Instead, I have some ideas about the generation process. I'm going to start with Warren Sack's Common Lisp version of Micro-Talespin (http://eliterature.org/images/microtalespin.txt), mostly for familiarity. I used the Micro-Mumble generation engine from the original Micro-Talespin (converting the original UCI Lisp source to Interlisp) in my dissertation work (Jim Meehan was my advisor), but it's been a _**very**_ long time, so it's doubtful that any of that past experience will be all that helpful.\r\n\r\nI have cheated a bit - I started looking at the code and did a few tweaks as I rebuilt my understanding. I'll include the Sack original and all my \"pre-start\" changes in an initial check-in after the starting gun sounds. Unfortunately, I don't seem to have my dissertation code, but it would all have to be converted to Common Lisp anyway, so perhaps that's no great loss.\r\n\r\nOversimplifying, I see four development areas: story setup, simulation, story-level  decisions, and tactical generation. This is roughly \"where do we start\", \"what happens\", \"what do we tell the reader and when\", and \"how do we say it.\" In Micro-Talespin, there are nearly-separable mechanisms for the simulator and tactical generation, but any story-level decisions are implicitly baked into the code, mostly amounting to \"tell them everything in the order it occurs.\" (The simulator and generator are OK to illustrate the approach, but both will need work to produce something reasonable.)\r\n\r\nI'm also interested in looking at using other sources of \"what happens\", such as event records extracted from news stories (e.g., http://www.gdeltproject.org/) in place of the simulator in Micro-Talespin, but whether the result would be \"novelistic\" is an open question.\r\n\r\nThe Talespin approach is OK for an episode. It remains to be seen if it can sustain a novel-length story. The idea of a framing story (as used by others) is one possibility, but there's clearly lots of experimentation ahead.\r\n\r\nYes, far too ambitious. We'll see where things are at the end of November.\r\n\r\nRepo is here: https://github.com/rbechtel/NaNoGenMo",

I’m interested in figuring out how to surface weird local legends and anecdotes that shape the human geography of each place—if that turns out to be too ambitious or too broad a scope, I guess I can always fall back on some sort of shlocky genre template conventions.\r\n\r\nI really wanted to participate in previous years, but wasn’t able to.

This should be good practice in working with natural language processors in order to generate poem-length memoir-esque bits of text -- which I can then use as the base for further novel expansions."

I forked [Darius's corpora repo](https://github.com/dariusk/corpora) linked in the NaNoGenMo resources and also found some good word lists on the internet for what I am looking for. Fun fact: as a middle school English teacher, I *loved* word lists, or \"word pools\" we would sometimes call them. The walls of my classroom were plastered with posters of color words, verbs, adjectives, sensory words, etc. (until mandatory testing took over the entire Spring and they had to be covered up).\r\n\r\nSticking with the corpora format, the word lists are in JSON. JavaScript isn't my first programming language, so I had to google \"how do I link a local JSON file to my javascript\" and Y'ALL this should be a lot easier, doncha think? I did not want to involve html files or ajax requests (eeek) or jQuery (no!), at least not yet, so I cheated by just making my word list files .js files and then requiring them.\r\n\r\nLike this: [Fear the Repo](https://github.com/marythought/where-im-from/blob/master/lib/poem.js)\r\n\r\nShush, You, I'll DRY it up later.\r\n\r\nI'm pretty happy with how it's shaping up, I love using RiTA to be able to control syllable length.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"637\" alt=\"screen shot 2015-11-02 at 6 21 49 pm\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10136229/10900083/40adb892-8190-11e5-895d-da1649258d27.png\">\r\n\r\nAs a reminder, the source poem is [here](https://github.com/marythought/where-im-from/blob/master/source_poem.txt).\r\n\r\nI'm hoping to finish assembling the poem tomorrow, then I can figure out where I want to take it from there. \r\n"

        "body": "## DAY ... TEN?\r\n\r\nOk, after taking some time off to learn all the data structures and algorithms (or not learn, as the case may be), I needed a quick win so I came back to this and was able to publish a version of the poem generator!\r\n\r\n[Where I'm From](https://whereimfrom.herokuapp.com/)\r\n\r\nIt's not very fancy, and probably breaks all the Node/Express rules (I am a very proficient Ruby on Rails developer seriously you should hire me), but it meets the prime objective of generating a new poem on demand.\r\n\r\nI like this so much I am not sure how to translate it into a novel... but let's not call it \"done\" yet, because I'm going to sleep on that.\r\n\r\nI found a couple open-source texts that work well for \"memoir\" style (Anne of Green Gables is the frontrunner), so I played with using RiTA to markov it up. My idea was to start with the base text, and then see if there's any way to prioritize the keywords generated in the 'Where I'm From' poem (so it would be a poem followed by short vignette featuring terms mentioned in that poem, and then more in that pattern).\r\n \r\n<img width=\"724\" alt=\"screen shot 2015-11-10 at 8 01 09 pm\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10136229/11083596/d8536614-87e5-11e5-9311-70392d3280b2.png\">\r\n\r\nIt's interesting, but it isn't very readable in paragraph form. So I think I need to consider another method for text generation. Which puts me back at the starting line. :)\r\n\r\nMaybe I'll just write more poems...? #NaPoGenMo! I'm not 100% invested in the novel form, at least not for my first experiment this year, but I'm shooting to adhere to the 50,000 word count..."

        "body": "## DAY ELEVENTHEN\r\n\r\nSome quick text to share, I'm playing with the RiTA RiLexicon to find near replacement words for a classic poem (again with the poems!!! she just won't stop...). My goal here is to generate output that is clearly recognizable, but sounds bananas. \r\n\r\nYou might be curious, what is the difference between Rita's RiLexicon methods similarBySound(), similarByLetter(), similarBySoundAndLetter(), and rhymes()? So glad you asked... let's take a look at each of these at play! Each method returns an array of matches, so the computer is choosing a random match (or the original word) each time. \r\n\r\n### Similar by Sound \r\n<em>Compares the phonemes of the input word (using a version of the min-edit distance algorithm) to each word in the lexicon, returning the set of closest matches.</em> \r\n\r\nTwo reeds divert in a yell good,\r\nAnd soggy I could not trammel berth\r\nAnd be one travels, pong I staid\r\nAnd cooked dean one as far as I curd\r\nTo where it burnt in the undergrowth;\r\n\r\n### Similar by Letter\r\n<em>Compares the characters of the input string (using a version of the min-edit distance algorithm) to each word in the lexicon, returning the set of closest matches.</em> \r\n\r\nTwo loads diverged in a fellow wood,\r\nAnd sorry I could not travel booth\r\nAnd be one traveler, song I stood\r\nAnd cooked dawn one as far as I mould\r\nTo where it bet in the undergrowth;\r\n\r\n### Similar by Sound and Letter\r\n<em>First calls similarBySound(), then filters the result set by the algorithm used in similarByLetter();</em>\r\n\r\nTwo rods diverge in a bellow good,\r\nAnd sorry I could not travel bath\r\nAnd be one traveled, pong I stood\r\nAnd cooked doan one as far as I could\r\nTo where it vent in the underwrote;\r\n\r\n### Rhyme\r\n<em>Two words rhyme are considered as rhyming if their final stressed vowel and all following phonemes are identical</em>\r\n\r\nTwo episodes diverged in a mellow likelihood,\r\nAnd safari I could not travel both\r\nAnd be one both, strong I sainthood\r\nAnd overlooked clown one as far as I withstood\r\nTo where it dissent in the undergrowth;\r\n\r\n### Verdict\r\nI hadn't tried by letter before this little exercise (thinking the sound would be more important) but I actually like that output the best, here. It does seem to be keeping the sound and rhythm of the word as well. Linguistical coincidence? Edit-distance magick? \r\n\r\nRhyme is clearly variating greatest from the source text -- this could be fun to play with for replacing end words (or generating new rhyme words) but I won't use it in this \"replace nearly every word\" exercise.\r\n\r\n### Just for fun: Alliteration\r\n<em>Finds alliterations by comparing the phonemes of the input string to those of each word in the lexicon</em>\r\n\r\nTwo razor diverged in a abuse wings,\r\nAnd scratch I could not fanatic both\r\nAnd be one entitled, rebuilding I ceases\r\nAnd consolidates deathbed one as far as I consul\r\nTo where it billionaires in the injuries\r\n\r\n^^Yikes, that's dark, RiTA! I won't be using this but watch this:\r\n\r\nTwo [roads organizational] diverged in a [yellow impugning] [wood whittle],\r\nAnd [sorry confessing] I could not [travel teapot] [both both]\r\nAnd be one [traveler tumbler], [long inflict] I [stood autistic]\r\nAnd [looked apologized] [down down] one as far as I [could clawed]\r\nTo where it [bent bittersweet] in the [undergrowth incinerators];\r\n\r\nThese are the word pairs it's claiming for alliteration. Some are truly weird. I feel like this would need some human editing if you were to use it in text generation, or else I might just throw out anything that doesn't start with the same letter as the base word (those all seem to work well!).\r\n\r\nSigning off for now, I'm going to keep working on Bob Frost then see what else I can do in RiTA."

    "body": "I actually have a game I've been thinking about writing that involves characters having conversation and the player trying to keep the other characters from overly offending each other by steering the conversation to safe topics. I haven't really experimented with procedural dialog yet, so this is as good an excuse as any. My novel will have certain characters who are in certain states. Each scene will generate a setting, and bring in some of the characters from the novel, and then run the dialog engine as they talk to each other about various things using mostly canned phrases and mad-lib replacement. Phrases will affect state and relationship in the other characters in the scene, as well as suggest topic transitions. The scene ends when a one or more characters have moved in threshold from one state to another (Fred likes Wilma -> Fred is mad at Wilma, etc).\r\n\r\nTo ensure story can complete, some characters will have a protected death state. While in this state, they are unable to be killed by means which can't be reverted in another scene. When the story selects a character who has been killed in protected death state to enter a new scene, he will explain why he is still alive. At various points in the novel, the protected death state will be removed.\r\n\r\nIn last chapter all protected deaths are removed. We get to see if the characters by the end of the book are getting along, or if they kill each other :)",

I'd rate them as going from hardest to easiest, though that's partially colored by my biases:\r\n\r\n* Making a book of speeches is probably the easiest, depending on how you go about it. A basic Markov chain randomization and some interesting source text is the most straightforward way, but there are an infinite number of ways you can approach this. Lots of unexplored ideas for getting it to make sense.\r\n* Medium difficulty is the poems. There are libraries that can help with detecting meter and rhyme, of various levels of accuracy; check the resource threads for a few of them. Or you can write your own if that's the part that interests you, since it's not a perfectly solved problem.\r\n* I'm personally biased towards the simulation approach at the moment...mostly because I haven't successfully gotten it to work yet. So that's probably the hardest, though it likely varies based on the quality of the prose you're aiming for. Also, this is probably going to be the approach that's most concerned with the larger structure of the text and least concerned about the fiddly linguistic details. Though again, that'll very based on how you design it.\r\n\r\nEither way, looking forward to seeing what you come up with."

This violation of the separation of church and state cannot stand! \r\n\r\n>Danae Marks used practical experience and common sense to make the claim that the universe is controlled by a magical force called 'Karma'. Danae Marks argued that Karma was a personal, physical being. She then held out a personal copy of the Bible. This 'Bible' came directly from Karma, but ignorant people have chosen to interpret the book literally. A literal interpretion is one that is doomed to failure. Only metaphors lead to success. Danae Marks smiled when she explained how Heaven and Hell are the same as the 'religious' people viewed it: good people go to Heaven and bad people go to Hell. Danae Marks then explained in depth how Karma is able to break scientific laws from time to time, causing 'miracles'. Danae Marks declared that Karma strongly supports clear ethical standards that all humans must obey. \r\n\r\n>The theists took notes."

        "body": "I know this sound surprising, considering this is a novel-writing competition...but I don't actually like novels. I always believe in conveying messages in as few words as possible, rather than filling the page with worthless purple prose. I enjoy reading novel synopses, not the novel.\r\n\r\nWhen writing this competition, I had two goals: 1) write a program that generates a novel, 2) write a program that generates a *meaningful* story.\r\n\r\nGoal 2 is a complete success, in my opinion. Each sentence conveys information about what a real person said over the telephone. Theoretically, someone may want to read more of the novel to find out about more atheists, although boredom will eventually set in for the reader...\r\n\r\nThe problem I'm having is Goal 1. Each sentence in my template is *too effective* at conveying the data. Each data point only really gives me one sentence (and sometimes even less!), and while there's 99 different atheists, that only means 99 sentences.\r\n\r\nMy estimate is that each \"chapter\" is about 200 words long. This means far from getting a glorious 50,000 words novel, I am stuck with a ~19,800 word novella.\r\n\r\nNow, there's a lot of data points that I am not using yet, and clearly using them will lead to more words to be stuffed into each chapter. But as text is efficient at conveying information, I'm going to have to exhaust a lot of data to reach my original quota of '505 words/chapter'. And each data point I add seems more and more tangential to the original purpose of the novel: to show the religious beliefs and practices of self-proclaimed atheists who believe in God. As a result, I may consider just abandoning Goal 1 entirely. It may be *possible* for me to get up to 505 words...but the cost may be a less meaningful story. And I think I prefer meaning more than mere word count.\r\n\r\nThere are also examples of people getting the Green *complete* tag despite not reaching the 50,000 word criteria too, so there's no shame in abandoning the pursuit for the Great White Novel."

Writing a novella that says everything that you wanted to is, to my mind, well within the bounds of NaNoGenMo. I've personally viewed the length as aspirational: we, collectively, don't know how to get a machine to write a _good_ novel, so we're slowly fumbling our way towards writing a _coherent_ novel, gradually trying to make each attempt more interesting.\r\n\r\nAs a practical matter, if I was in your place, I'd step back from thinking about the length and turn instead to the problem of keeping the reader's interest for more chapters. Is there a way you can add more variability? But I'm not in your place. You get to be the one to declare it complete, on your terms."

How do you get a machine to fill that space in a \"sensible\" way?  Or do you even try?  If not, what do you accept for \"not sensible\" ways to fill it?  And why?\r\n\r\nTo me, answering those questions is probably just as central to NaNoGenMo as the actual generating of text.  If it was simply billed as a computer story-writing jam or something, with a reasonable word count goal, I probably wouldn't have bothered to look into it.\r\n\r\nSo, you could say I am rather strongly pro-taking-50K-words-seriously.  (I'm also rather strongly pro-novel-means-NOVEL-gosh-darn-it, at least in odd-numbered years, but that's a slightly different matter.)\r\n\r\nThat said, I'm virtually in the same boat as you @tra38, and I don't have any good ideas.\r\n\r\nMy current plan is to generate two versions of my novel at the end: one at readable length, the other a 50K word version to get the Completed label even though 98% of it will be pure [wharrgarbl](http://i1.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/032/388/wharrgarbl.jpg).\r\n"

    "body": "In a 2007 survey by Pew Forum on Religion, 21% of self-proclaimed atheists believe in God or a universal spirit.\r\n\r\nThe most plausible explanation I have for this phenomena is that these 'atheists' just don't know what term to use to represent their unique belief system, and so just relied on atheism as a good substitute. This explanation is backed by my analysis of a 2010 survey where Pew asked some God-believing atheists what is the definition of atheism (and most got the answer correct). That being said, there ***are*** some belief systems that would be compatible with atheism: Spinoza's pantheism, Buddhism, and Simulationism (the belief that we are living in a computer simulation). I mention these three belief systems because I actually encountered these three atheists online.\r\n\r\nLet's write a novel based on these people. Pew has released the 2007 survey dataset in 2008, so it's just a matter of parsing the data, and then feeding it into a mad-libby template. The hope is that people would want to read the novel past the first few pages because it's based on real life survey data. You're reading about what a real person told a pollster on the phone! That has to be exciting.\r\n\r\nEach chapter will discuss about one of these atheists, using information about them to construct a plausible narrative of their day-to-day life, with an emphasis on their religious practices and beliefs. For example, if one of these atheists claim to meditate, then I might mention him (or her) mediating. Details that are not in the survey dataset (such as their name) will be randomly generated, thereby ensuring that this is a fictional work...",

I'm going to take an approach of high level to low level via an outline, like chapter 1:\r\nChapter about setting\r\nChapter about character 1\r\nChapter about character 2\r\nCharacters talk\r\nDangerous situation occurs\r\nCharacters overcome dangerous situation\r\nCharacters travel to new setting.\r\n\r\nThis will probably be pretty tedious. I'm going to capture a sense of history by storing what has previously happened to characters in the past and try to generate some sentences and paragraphs based on that to give a sense of continuity. Also doing some sort of simulations for characters trying to resolve conflicts.\r\n\r\n**Technologies**\r\nI have a git repo of Python tools I plan on using: https://github.com/mattfister/wordtools\r\n\r\nThis includes an offline version of ConceptNet that I made, some vocab lists, and some general linguistic tools I've been working on.\r\n\r\nAll of my code will probably be in Python."

I had a skeleton of a setting describer in place so now I'm generating some characters and moving them from setting to setting. Each setting is described using data from [ConceptNet](http://conceptnet5.media.mit.edu/) and some added props. I also added a markdown and html formatter so I can actually get something published. I found [pypandoc](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pypandoc/) was great for my purposes.\r\n\r\nThe main accomplishment today was setting up the infrastructure to carry the state of the story so I can continue filling in the details as I go. Up front I'm generating a state which consists of a series of settings and the primary characters. As the novel progresses the characters are moved from setting from setting. Each setting has a chapter generated about it. The chapter generates its paragraphs (just one for now about the setting).\r\n\r\nRemaining goals:\r\n* Many more kinds of paragraphs\r\n* A beginning and end of the novel\r\n* Primary characters that enter and exit the novel\r\n* Secondary characters\r\n* Characters that change over the course of the novel\r\n\r\nWhat could help me the most:\r\nRight now I have a really disorganized approach to sentence generation. I'm going to get to the point where I want sentences about a certain thing, but my current approach is manual and unadaptable. I think I would be well served with some sort of easy intermediate format for sentence generation that could be translated to English. This would probably take the form of a recursive templating expression."

It was a crazy week so way less progress than I hoped for.\r\n\r\nStill I got a bunch of new features done, so I'm happy.\r\n\r\n* Attributes are now being tracked on characters. Think d6 sort of role-playing system. Each character has attributes for lore, survival, and combat, but it's really simple for me to add other attributes.\r\n* When generating setting paragraphs, lore challenges are conducted to have character discuss the history of the place.\r\n* Food and energy are now being tracked for the party. If they are low on food, a character will go fishing, hunting, or gathering. This is a new paragraph that is appended to the chapter.\r\n*Characters have memories from their youth. If they face a challenging situation, like hunting, they may recall when they went hunting as kids or something.\r\n* If characters have a success or failure, they may have their current 'quality' replaced by a new negative or positive quality. So Darren the Devious may become Darren the Dependable (alliteration unlikely).\r\n\r\nI'm happy with the hunting, fishing, and gathering paragraphs I'm generating, but I realize the templates for them really show. I'm not going to pursue another text generation strategy for this year's nanogenmo at this point, but maybe next year I'll have something that allows for some more variety.\r\n\r\nOne thing I just ran out of time on today was generating camping paragraphs. I want to deliver the sense that the night is dangerous and a time of strangeness so you'll get weird dreams and sounds in the darkness. That should be easy to do and coming up soon.\r\n\r\nHere's my favorite sample chapter from today's output.\r\n\r\n>**The Windmill**\r\n>\r\n>Joaquin the profound, Billie Nicholson, and Darin traveled to a windmill. Joaquin the profound exclaimed, \"I hate this place.\" There was a cow inside the windmill. There was a button inside the windmill. The windmill was a windpump. The windmill could power entire town. Darin Schuler stated, \"This is a very dangerous windmill.\" The button was an artifact. Joaquin Hart mentioned, \"This place was once known as 'Iaaemlbaehh Ladodwi'.\" Joaquin thought about how a button was similar to a foil. Darin proclaimed, \"Let's move on.\"\r\n>\r\n>Billie the innocent mentioned, \"Our food should last a bit longer.\" Billie decided to go hunting. Billie remembered hunting with her best friend as a child. She searched the windmill for signs of caribous. But she failed to find any caribou signs. Billie returned to Joaquin empty handed. Billie the innocent exclaimed, \"We will have to just keep going, there was no food to find here.\" Because of this great failure Billie the innocent became known as 'The Interfering'."

    "body": "I'm really happy to participate again to this project, so I thought about it for a few weeks already and I have two ideas, I'll create an issue for the other one if I have time to complete this first one.\r\n\r\nFor the first one, I intend to generate a play of +50k words in french based on the forum posts of the website [Jeuxvideo.com](http://www.jeuxvideo.com/) (biggest french website on video games)\r\nThe \"Blabla\" forums of Jeuxvideo.com are famous for being the \"french 4chan\" although posts don't vanish and boards are more organized and moderated. Still, a lot of very ugly and/or strange things are posted every day and the community around there can be really scary, funny and/or just weird.\r\n\r\nThe idea was inspired by [a news article about the forums of this website](http://tempsreel.nouvelobs.com/medias/20150924.OBS6430/antisemitisme-homophobie-fanatisme-jeuxvideo-com-la-ruche-a-fiel.html) The title helps to get a glimpse of what can be found there : \"Antisemitism, homophobia, fanatism\", and we could add a lot more to the list. Anyway, at one point, the journalist writes \"This forum, it's like a play, sometimes funny, sometimes tragic.\" That gave me the idea.\r\n\r\nI plan to mostly use two of the main boards of the forums that are [\"Blabla 15-18\"](http://www.jeuxvideo.com/forums/0-50-0-1-0-1-0-blabla-15-18-ans.htm) and [\"Blabla 18-25\"](http://www.jeuxvideo.com/forums/0-51-0-1-0-1-0-blabla-18-25-ans.htm) (it's an \"age\" classification) where teenagers and young adults talk about anything and everything. I will translate most common smileys into stage directions next to the dialogues and do a scene for every different topic.\r\n\r\nI have to think about some filtering for the topics maybe (use topics that are not too long nor too short), and maybe try to add some thematic or binding between each scene.",

Confringo is a parliamentary republic with a central government based in the capital Ferdasia, local governments in 317 municipalities,[9] and an autonomous region, the Trandal Islands. Over 1.4 million people live in the Greater Ferdasia metropolitan area, which produces a third of the country's GDP. Other large cities include Rempart, Krut, Luou, Kylajaki, Hilta, and Piok."

        "body": "After spending a while awake in bed thinking, I've decided on two driving points:\r\na) Given how much work people have put into narrative generation and yet even the best academic systems aren't there yet, trying to do something of that scale in a month is silly.\r\nb) I'm a borderline perfectionist and wouldn't be overly happy with something 'meh' just because I tried doing far too much.\r\n\r\nAs such, I'm still going to be trying to do far too much! But...differently!\r\n\r\nA rough overview of my plans - for now:\r\n1- Get a very rough propp-based plot. Translate the plots into goals (e.g. the 'return' Propp function is a goal to end up at location X).\r\n2- Throw in a whole bunch of characters, locations, objects, etc. I'll see if a corpus exists, otherwise I'll probably manually find some from e.g. IF games.\r\n3- Give each character a small number of emotions and beliefs - e.g. hunger, safety, greed, whatever. This is the novel bit, I think. it's also the bit most likely to completely fall flat.\r\n4- Let the characters run amok ala The Swallows (which I must say is absolutely brilliant and has given me and my friends a sore throat from laughing). \r\n5- Generate the story - which, I am hoping, might end up looking a little like something from dwarf fortress. Everyone loves a dwarf grabbing a goblin by the tongue with their pinky, ripping it out, and beating them to death with it!\r\n\r\n1) shouldn't be too hard - the resource list in @MichaelPaulukonis' NaNoGenMo2014 is absolutely staggering. Originally I was talking about using Plotto for a plot, but that's just going to lead to extreme templatisation - something I don't really want at all.\r\n2) also shouldn't be bad. Worst case? Grab an ontology or similar and go to town. Could be downright hilarious if, for instance, the hero really needs to go collect the magical Acetaldehyde Ethyl Phenylethyl Acetal by riding in his Alfa Romeo 155. Which goes about 5mph.\r\n3) This is where it all falls down, I imagine. I've been interested in this kindof model but never really looked into it. We'll have to see!\r\n4) Shouldn't be too hard. Just got to make sure I add some kind of urgency so we don't get them running around in circles for *too* long.\r\n5) Also not too bad.\r\n\r\nAnyway, we'll see."

Especially when I don't understand the bulk of their work. But I love the angle of attack that NaNoGenMo brings to the problem - sideways, cargo-cult, worst-practices surface-FX that leap-frog over academic problems to get to a semi-readable end-point. _Eliza_ is dumb from an AI standpoint, but continues to be an important touchstone, showing how simple effects can be used (believed, read, whatever) by a non-academic user/reader.\r\n\r\nAnd am a bit jealous, because I have no clear goal yet for this month..... I think scaling back to a single type of story might be interesting (_The Giant Who Had No Heart in His Body_ or _Koschei the Deathless_). Not necessarily the output, but I might find it interesting to work on."

        "body": "2 days down, 29 to go!\r\n\r\nI'm going to try and get all 5 elements in a somewhat working state, then see about expanding on them. I've got 2 in the works!\r\n\r\nFirst, I've started on a Proppian plot generator. Currently it'll randomly select elements - such that pairwise functions and the like are respected (so it won't try and violate an interdiction but not ever give an interdiction). It also outputs a very brief overview of the plot, just using Propp's titles:\r\n\r\n```\r\nOnce upon a time, an introduction to the hero.\r\nLater, an interdiction is given to the hero.\r\nLater, the villain attempts to deceive their victim to take possession of them/their belongings.\r\nSoon after, the villain causes harm or injury to a member of the family.\r\nLater, one member of a family either lacks something or desires something.\r\nSoon after, misfortune or lack is made known; the hero is approached with a request or command; they are allowed to go or are dispatched.\r\nLater, the seeker agrees to or decides upon counteraction.\r\nSoon after, the hero leaves home.\r\nLater, the hero is tested.\r\nLater, the hero reacts to the actions of the future donor.\r\nThen, the hero acquires the use of a magical agent.\r\nLater, the hero and villain join in direct combat.\r\nThen, the villain is defeated.\r\nThen, the initial misfortune is liquidated\r\nThen, the hero returns.\r\nSoon after, the hero, unrecognised, arrives home or in another country.\r\nThen, a false hero presents unfounded claims.\r\nThen, a difficult task is proposed to the hero.\r\nLater, the task is resolved.\r\nSoon after, the hero is recognised.\r\nThen, the false hero is exposed.\r\nLater, the hero receives a reward.\r\nThe end.\r\n```\r\n\r\nCurrently working out a good mix of having plenty of elements and not just using every single possible event.\r\n\r\nI took a quick detour to write a small script to extract useful data from the NELL ontology - I figured this might give some more interesting data for e.g. objects. It has over 37,000 things it labels as 'food'! Sadly it seems I can't get names from this, but I can get objects (food, drink, types of locations, etc).\r\n\r\nI've also settled for medieval stasis. Each story will be set in a world with (at least one) a city, a small village, and a 'wilderness' location. Then, potentially, there may be extra cities, villages, and wilderness locations. \r\n\r\nCurrently I can add characters, put them somewhere, move them..but they don't do anything:\r\n```\r\nBob is in the Hillington city gate and has done nothing.\r\nAlice is in the Hillington city gate and has done nothing.\r\n```\r\nProbably need to get some directions there so they're standing by the gate or whatever.\r\n\r\nAnd for current goals (next day or so):\r\n\r\nWith regards to actors, I'm going for something like talespin. Each character ('characters' are people and special interest/magical animals) has a number of needs; hunger, thirst, safety, socialising, potentially more. These increase or decrease. If they hit a certain limit, the character gets a new goal. A character can have many current goals (e.g. safety will be the highest priority). Every world step, the character will do something to complete a goal. If they have no goals, they'll probably wander around/socialise/explore/try to find things out. I hope.\r\n\r\nThe propp functions will be part of these goals. For the specific characters (hero, donor, etc) they will be considered as a need. This need goes up as the story progresses to make sure progress actually happens; e.g. if in the violation phase but the violation hasn't happened, the hero will get a low-priority goal to actively violate the interdiction. I'm not sure whether this'll work. It could be that the story never progresses unless they explicitly aim for it, which'd be odd ('here is 10 pages of Bob looking around the forest and chatting to his mum, then he decides the best idea is to go marry the princess') - but given I'm trying to feed as much as I can from a corpus and I might end up with a character deciding to eat 'Kit Anderson's Bad Attitude Barbecue Sauce'...it'll be good.\r\n\r\nI hope!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Goals seem to be working fine. Currently the hunger ticks up (they do nothing), and when it hits the threshold they'll get a hunger goal (I AM BECOME HUNGER). There's a list of things they do under certain conditions - I love prolog so much for this - and each of those will add a new goal at higher priority (very slightly - so it'll override hunger, but not anything more important). The rough ordering currently is to get food (if they know it's nearby), look for food (if they don't), ask someone (if someone is nearby), go to the nearest food they've seen before (exploring along the way), or to explore areas they've not been to try and find food."

The example I've got is hunger; it works well, I feel:\r\nhttp://i.imgur.com/OWKaaXu.png\r\n\r\nThe best bit about Prolog is how homogeneous everything is; by changing 2 words from 'food' to 'character' I've managed to create cannibals! http://puu.sh/l9mcy/186576eeec.png \r\nYou might notice that Bob tries to pick up Bob and fails...there was a bug originally where characters could pick up themselves. This ended up with an...interesting situation where Bob picked up Bob, and then *ate himself*. Alice also picked herself up..and ate herself. They still existed, in the void - just..having eaten themselves. At least it stopped them being hungry, I guess.\r\n\r\nI also had a realisation that I was going under some serious feature creep. As such, for now - and probably it'll be left as such - the world will be the same between stories. Names, people, plot - all different; however the layout of the city and world and stuff will be the same and is hardcoded in for now.\r\n\r\nAnother realisation (as I think I discussed in the Slack) is that I couldn't continue with my original plan - that is, have something reading like The Swallows, but have a sensible and realistic plot thread throughout. The best idea was to move to one or the other, and I've chosen the former. Getting sensible, realistic plot and whatnot is far too hard for 3 weeks. I'm now entirely rolling with the absurdity! I can predict the story will be something like:\r\n\r\n```\r\nBob went and ate some food.\r\nBob walked around and talked about birds.\r\nBob's mum went to sleep.\r\nBob's mum died suddenly. (As the absentation goal fires).\r\nBob eats food.\r\nBob goes to sleep.\r\nBob leaves for the city. (As the hero departs).\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf this actually stretches to 50,000 words...I can imagine 30 pages of utter nonsense followed by 2 sentences containing the entire plot, repeated 30 times. \r\n\r\nAll I hope is that I can make it good enough!\r\n\r\n"

This isn't going to end up with 50,000 words in any sane capability. I think something which seems a lot more like a very long, linear, short story IS possible; that is, the plot events become incredibly granular and small (if a normal novel has, say, 10 different major events in 50k words - this will probably have 200-300). \r\n\r\nIt could also be that this is all complete garbage and I'll swap to a destructive approach from existing material.

        "body": "On GenText, I hand-wrote some examples of \"fixed\" passages that can be randomly assembled and then  linked together by transitions. The end result is that you can get different plots, which make sense because of the transitions. Recently, I got time to convert my handwritten approach into an algorithm (which you can see [here](https://github.com/tra38/Architect/blob/master/state_machine.rb)). I am doubtful if this approach can scale up to 50,000 words, but I am likely going to use this approach for the Dartmouth Turing Test for the Creative Arts.\r\n\r\nMy idea of organizing plot by random reordering of passages came from a 1990's computer program: Dramatica. Dramatica is a computer program that is able to generate out a fairy complex outline for a \"grand argument story\", though it does expect you to use that outline to handwrite out the story. Each outline has 4 subplots, and each subplot represents a certain \"theme\" (let's say Manipulation). Each subplot is composed of four different \"acts\", each representing a certain aspect of 'Manipulation''. However, it is the ***order*** of these acts that matter in determining the effect of the subplot on the greater plot. Obviously, Dramatica is a far more complex program than just randomly shuffling events within an array and then popping them out. There are additional rules involved to ensure that the \"grand argument story\" is logical and has no holes that a reader can use to attack its point. But most of these rules have nothing to do with the organization of the plot structure, and everything to do with how it is presented within the text (characterization, etc.)."

        "body": "# Postmortem of Previous Projects\r\nFor this, the third NaNoGenMo, I've been trying to brainstorm an approach builds on some of the things I was aiming for in my two previous attempts.\r\n\r\n[Gutenberg Shuffle](https://github.com/dariusk/NaNoGenMo/issues/63), and the related results from 2013, were based on the idea that stealing sentence-level content from existing texts would be more cohesive. Feeding those sentences into a generator and replacing names with a list of proper nouns culled from an analysis of the complete text would theoretically result in a novel about a recurring cast of characters who could take any action that was described somewhere in the source text.\r\n\r\nI had some dreams about adding some context to the individual sentences, either through a hand annotation process, or some kind of automated analysis, so that the characters would have some idea of which actions belonged together. This didn't happen. Still an interesting idea, but very ambitious.\r\n\r\nI also wanted to add the ability to draw dialogue from the source text, but I ran out of month before I could successfully implement the analysis to scrape the dialogue in the format I needed it to be in.\r\n\r\nI do like the idea of titling the chapters based on analysis of the contents. In this case it was just the longest word in the chapter, but I think the general principle of layering generators on top of each other is a potentially powerful approach. While it's hard to extract meaningful context from arbitrary text, it's much easier to extract something relevant from text that you've generated, particularly if you still have the metadata.\r\n\r\nEnglish gender and tense are also kind of annoying when you're trying to parse arbitrary text. Having a great really good library to deal with that, and other similar fiddly bits can probably go a long way into speeding experimentation.\r\n\r\n[For 2014, I switched approaches.](https://github.com/dariusk/NaNoGenMo-2014/issues/35) The limitation of generating data based on arbitrary source text was that it lacked any kind of larger structure. I decided that a recursive series of nested generators, patterned after the manner of the 1001 Arabian Nights, would be a good starting point.\r\n\r\nThe primary generator borrowed some concepts from 2013, such as the characters who had concepts of outputting sentences that represent actions that they took, but in a more hand-scripted way. (I had ideas of training them to use arbitrary input sentences again, but once again discovered that that took a lot of time.) \r\n\r\nThe basic design was a modular set of text generators, any of which could feed into each other. Most of the month was taken up with the framework for the different generators. So by the end only three generators were actually implemented: the storytelling generator, the Library of Babel generator, and the exploring a maze generator. To really pull off the concept, I think the planned but not implemented modules that told more detailed stories or parts of stories would've gone a long way to getting more interesting results.\r\n\r\nOne bit about the maze generator that I like is that the maze that they are exploring is the actual data structure of the story that they're inhabiting. Each node in the data structure is a room in the maze. The rooms and decoration of the labyrinth use the properties of the current node in the data structure as a seed for the random template, so exploring the same data structure will result in the same maze. I like the way that it gives an additional layer of meaning, though I'm afraid this is mostly obscured by the labyrinth being somewhat repetitive and without a lot of action going on other than exploring and reading randomly generated books. \r\n\r\nI'm tempted to take the basic framework and start implementing a bunch of new and improved modules that take the project in a different direction, but there's been a lot of tools released in the past year or so in other languages that makes some of the basic text fiddling or analysis tasks easier so I'm also tempted to switch to something like Python."

        "body": "My prior commitments mean that I most likely won't get to write any code for at least a week, but at least I can spend part of that time brainstorming ideas.\r\n\r\n**Sentiment analysis** — having some way to categorize arbitrary text is, I think, a highly useful way to add additional order and coherence to the generation. While sentiment analysis isn’t the only possible way to do this, it is a relatively well understood way to do it. I haven't had this in past projects, and I'd like to have it (or something similar) this year.\r\n\r\n**Travel story** — this seems to be a kind of theme in people’s planning this year; invoking _On The Road_ or various travel tales. I like it as a concept. Partially because it invokes Italio Calvino’s _Invisible Cities_. But of course there’s a long tradition of travel stories, including Marco Polo, Ulysses, and so on. It’s an obvious way to structure a modular, episodic narrative and yet give it some kind of larger structure: the different cities or islands visited can each stand on their own, while the ongoing journey can give a sense of progress.\r\n\r\nThere are a number of ways I can think to approach this, including it using actual geographic data to structure a novel: for example a fictionalized rendition of the Marco Polo-esque journey along the Silk Road. For that matter there are number of historical roads or routes that could have a similar treatment: the Oregon Trail, the Orient express, a number of sea voyages along coasts, the Appalachian Trail, traversing the various rivers that make up the Amazon, and so on. Especially if you have a data source that allows you to create a graph of the nodes that will be visited during the story.\r\n\r\nOne possible source of data is ORBIS, the Stanford geospatial network model of the Roman world. I don’t know if they allow automated access to the data, rather than just the web interface to the model, but it would be a fascinating way to structure a historical journey through the Roman Empire. If you couple this with the Perseus Digital Library’s Place search function, it should be theoretically possible to assemble an automated travelogue of the Roman Empire based on primary source texts. Again I’m not sure if the Perseus Digital Library allows this kind of automated access, but I’d love to find out.\r\n\r\nI do know that the Perseus Digital Library allows you to download the original XML text files under CC-NC-SA-3.0.\r\n\r\n**External source data** — one thing I noticed when comparing my 2013 efforts with my 2014 project, is that the use of some kind of larger external data source greatly increased the interest level I had in reading individual paragraphs. My 2013 project lacked the kind of larger skill coherence that allowed this interest to be sustained. But as a general rule I think using some kind of large source data, even if it’s just pulling random words from the dictionary to flavor sentences, will generate a more interesting novel overall.\r\n\r\n**Stellar Catalogs** — links to this idea of external data sources, and because I happen to have a stellar catalog line around from a different project, the thought struck me that using this to structure all or part of a novel might be interesting. There is a lots of symbolism bound up in humanity’s relationship with the stars. Not only is there mythology and other astronomical and astrological associations, but in a travel story stars can be used as a way to navigate. Not to mention that’s constellations are another form of structure.\r\n\r\n**Simulation** — some of my favorite works from past NaNoGenMos have used simulation as a basis for their storytelling. To my mind, this is an especially powerful approach, because on some level a simulation is something that actually happens: that is to say, the simulated thing exists. Even if it is not identifiable with the thing it pretends to represent, it is always an existent thing in its own right. \r\n\r\nThe downside of course, is that mere existence is no guarantee of interestingness. The bottom-up approach is often very repetitive and takes quite a bit of work to make it into an interesting story. Not to mention that, like many procedural generation approaches, it takes a large amount of source processes to result in enough variation to make the effort worth it. \r\n\r\n(This does suggest that if we could find some way to do massive data and process creation along the same principles as Big Data, with millions or billions of coherent cybertextual textons and scriptions, the result might be exponentially more interesting.)\r\n\r\n**Fictional versus nonfictional sources** — the advantage of generating a novel set in some approximation of the real world is that there is an immense amount of source material available to express nonfictional concepts. The advantage of a novel set in a fictional setting is that it is less likely to conflict with known facts about the real world. Since any given setting exists on a spectrum from highly realistic and or nonfictional at one end to largely fictional on the other. But seldom entirely fictional: even a work set in another dimension, like Flatland, conforms to a certain kind of physics.\r\n\r\n**Character dialogue** — one way, I think, to rapidly convey a number of different characters is to give them a modularized way to spout dialogue that matches their personality. I’d like to implement dialog contents that would let new characters pick tics or other ways to personalize their reaction to events.\r\n\r\n**Emergence versus progression** — based on Jesper Juul’s Open and Closed systems, I believe that cybertextual systems are built out of nested open, closed, and rhizomic systems. As a direct consequence of this, is my personal belief that procedural generation that exists within a closed progression framework is just as valid as that which is completely emergent. Therefore, I think it’s perfectly reasonable to, for example, set up a framework so that certain chapters use the generators I select.\r\n\r\nObviously at one end of the spectrum, you have a mostly human-written story with some machine variation, while at the other end, you have the dream of the entire early machine generated creative story. While story generation as a whole is gradually working towards this latter end of the spectrum, there is a whole range of artistic possibilities at every point along the way.\r\n\r\nHowever, I also believe that a tightly designed simulation is perfectly capable of replicating the rising and falling tension of a traditional plot. The trick, of course, is teaching the computer which in-story elements correspond to the achievements and setbacks of the protagonists. This is easier from a top-down perspective than a bottom-up perspective, so I believe that right now the easiest results are going to be from a very abstracted the simulation. But my central point is that, just as a chess game has an opening, a middle game, and an end game, so too can our story simulation.\r\n\r\nNote that this isn’t exactly the same as simulating a plot, I’m more interested in simulating a situation or scenario, and letting the other parts of the system try to narrate a story out of it.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAt the moment, I'm leaning towards doing some kind of travel story. Too much Star Trek and Mass Effect this week tempt me to set it in a science fiction space opera environment, though there may be more source material to draw on if I use Marco Polo or Ulysses as a model instead.\r\n\r\nThe trick with a simple travel narrative, is that it basically chews up content as fast as you can generate it. I can see two solutions this problem: the first is to dedicate a lot of time generating a high degree of variability in the content so that the combinatorial result is greater than the original effort. The second, is to abandon the strict travel narrative and have some kind of meta-strategy simulation going on."

        "body": "When writing stuff manually, I always had a hard time writing \"dialogue\". Or rather, I can write dialogue, but test readers find it too wooden and dull. So recently, I *stopped* writing dialogue. Instead, I wrote text that conveys the same message as dialogue, but not any actual \"speech\". This way, I could convey expository information without necessarily needing to focus on the exact words to say. \r\n\r\nFor example (from an incomplete work that I did hand-write):\r\n\r\n>I didn’t so much as speak a word to von Papen before he launched into a tirade against me and my office. Why didn’t I stop the syndicalist uprisings on the Eastern Front? Why was I unable to predict that France would invade Alsace-Lorraine? Why was the Combined Syndicate able to take countermeasures against our sabotage plans? Are the Abwehr too distracted chasing after paranoid fantasies to actually perform their assigned duties?\r\n\r\n>I pointed out that the Abwehr has some successes. For example, we---but then von Papen silenced me. He was not going to let me defend myself.\r\n\r\n>He angrily pointed out that the previous head of the Abwehr did a much better job than I ever did. Yes, Konrad was just a syndicalist spy, but he was willing to purge his rival syndicalists with much vigor and strength as any Kaiser loyalist, and he performed his duties competently. To von Papen, I’m little more than a partisan hack.\r\n\r\n>Ehrhart then came in, and told von Papen that the Kaiser sent him an urgent telegram. von Papen told me to stay in his room, and then ran out with Ehrhart. As I wait for him to come back, I looked at my brown suitcase waringly. Do I open it? Do I blackmail von Papen?\r\n\r\nNot a single quote in sight, yet I conveyed so much information (emotion state of von Papen, the plot, the relationship of the characters to each other) that quotes would be utterly superfluous.\r\n\r\nYou can say \"Alice angrily spoke to Bob. Alice wanted to know why Bob forgot to do the dishes this week.\" and I think we can fill in the blanks and determine that Alice was speaking to Bob about the dishes. You can also replace 'angrily spoke' with any other word phrase that indicates anger (harangue, scream, cursed, etc.), and the same message would be conveyed."

        "body": "@tra38 That's a useful way to approach it. It's much easier to generate the intent of the conversation than the exact words.\r\n\r\n**Lessons Learned so Far:**\r\n\r\n* If you're building libraries on Windows using MinGW, MSYS is a necessary part of that because that's where useful programs like install.exe reside. Or, if you go with Anaconda + prebuilt OpenBLAS + gensym, it seems to work on my system without much fuss.\r\n\r\n* The guten-gutter script by @cpressy is a handy way to clean up Project Gutenberg files. However, it fails on non-English texts and texts that have a really long title in the START block. Unicode may give you some issues; I ended up converting everything to UTF-8 anyway before running it. Also, you need to run it under Python 2, or run 2to3 on it to change one line to use str, since Python 3 handles Unicode strings differently.\r\n\r\n* I anticipate that I'm also going to have to clean up the word wrapping: most Gutenberg texts conform to 80-column widths, but many analysis approaches don't recognize sentences as continuing across the boundary. Using the HTML version of the text would probably solve this, but I only thought of that just now.\r\n\r\n* I'm using Python this year because I want to borrow its ecosystem: there are a lot of mature tools like NLTK and word2vec that have accessible Python libraries with documentation. I plan to eventually return to Clojure / JVM, but for the specific thing I'm trying this year I think I'll have less to implement myself, letting me get to the generation part faster. \r\n\r\nNext step: learn how to train word2vec on a corpus. Anyone got a tutorial?"

Perhaps that.\r\n\r\n - http://forum.makega.me/t/procedural-narrative-dialogue/91\r\n - http://www.blog.radiator.debacle.us/2014/04/second-times-charm-procedural-npc.html\r\n - http://koobazaur.com/gamedev/game-design/writing-branching-game-conversations/\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI'm also still interested in Fairy Tales.\r\nIn particular, a portion of some tales where the hero befriends several characters/creatures [despite (his) haste or advice] which then end up helping him get through a nested problem. Eg, the giant's heart is kept in a box at the top of a tower on an island in a lake past the thorns, past a guard-dragon, etc etc. I'd like to be able to generate a n-level deep problem with associated helper characters -- each of whom would have to have an attribute matched to solving the problem (bear kills dragon, eagle flies hero over lake, etc.). This would also involve some minimal conversations.\r\n\r\nNot exactly _fascinating_ textually when strung out to 50K words, but I'm curious to see how a deeply nested problem would work -- say, 300 levels with unique creates, and problems to overcome.\r\n"

        "body": "Another sample, not much changed - but some better corpii being used:\r\n\r\n> A king had seven sons, and when the other six went off to find brides, he kept the youngest with him because he could not bear to be parted from them all. They were supposed to bring back a bride for him, as well, but they found a king with six daughters and wooed them, forgetting their brother. But when they returned, they passed too close to a giant's castle, and he turned them all, both princes and princesses, to stone in a fit of rage.\r\n\r\n> When they did not return, the king, their father, tried to prevent their brother from following, but he went.\r\n\r\n> On the way, he helped a wolverine-chimpanzee, he helped a Warg-Typhon, he helped a tiger-Manticore, he helped a Hippocampus-ocelot, and gave a starving mule-giraffe his horse to eat. The mule-giraffe let the prince ride on him, instead, and showed him the giant's castle, telling him to go inside. The prince was reluctant fearing the wrath of the giant, but the mule-giraffe consoled him. The mule-giraffe persuaded the prince to enter the castle for there he would encounter not the giant, but the princess the giant kept prisoner.\r\n\r\n> The princess was very beautiful and the prince wanted to know how he could kill the giant and set her and his family free. The princess said that there was no way, as the giant did not keep his heart in his body and therefore could not be killed. When the giant returned, the princess hid the prince, and asked the giant where he kept his heart. He told her that it was under the door sill. The prince and princess dug there the next day and found no heart. The princess strewed flowers over the door sill, and when the giant returned, told him that it was because his heart lay there. The giant admitted it wasn't there and told her it was in the cupboard. As before, the princess and the prince searched, to no avail; once again, the princess strewed garlands of flowers on the cupboard and told the giant it was because his heart was there. Thereupon the giant revealed to her that, in fact, there was a dank drumlin field with a ocelot-Gnome, beyond that there was a fluorescent tepui with a Kobold-Hippogriff, beyond that there was a overlooked shield volcano with a Typhon-panda, beyond that there was a whimsical bayou with a Nix-Roc, beyond that there was a tiny subglacial mound with a Oni-mynah bird, and in the Oni-mynah bird's nest was an egg; and in the egg was the giant's heart.\r\n\r\n> The prince rode to the dank drumlin field, where the mule-giraffe jumped to attention. The prince called on the wolverine-chimpanzee to defeat the ocelot-Gnome. The wolverine-chimpanzee defeated the ocelot-Gnome by using its Thaumaturgy. The prince rode on to the fluorescent tepui, where he was menaced by a Kobold-Hippogriff. The prince called on the Warg-Typhon to defeat the Kobold-Hippogriff. The Warg-Typhon defeated the Kobold-Hippogriff by using its Drought. The prince rode on to the overlooked shield volcano, where he was menaced by a Typhon-panda. The prince called on the tiger-Manticore to defeat the Typhon-panda. The tiger-Manticore defeated the Typhon-panda by using its Perspicuity. The prince rode on to the whimsical bayou, where he was menaced by a Nix-Roc. The prince called on the Hippocampus-ocelot to defeat the Nix-Roc. The Hippocampus-ocelot defeated the Nix-Roc by using its Physics Manipulation. The prince rode on to the tiny subglacial mound, where he was menaced by a Oni-mynah bird. The prince called on the mule-giraffe to defeat the Oni-mynah bird. The mule-giraffe defeated the Oni-mynah bird by using its Fish Manipulation. The mule-giraffe plucked the egg from the nest of the Oni-mynah bird, gave it to the prince, and told him to squeeze it. When he did, the giant screamed. The mule-giraffe told him to squeeze it again, and the giant promised anything if he would spare his life. The prince told him to change his brothers and their brides back to life, and the giant did so. Then the prince squeezed the egg into two and went home with the giant's captive princess as his bride; accompanying him were his brothers and their brides, and the king rejoiced.\r\n"

        "body": "@tra38 that sad, looping story has been implemented, with a few other minor features -- mostly regarding grammar of some sections. Could be worse!\r\n\r\nI hold out the possibility of using ConceptNet to add .... something to the text -- where the powers relate to the holder, or some sort of descriptions. I dunno. Maybe it's time to move in a different direction for the rest of the month.\r\n\r\nA 54K word chunk may be found [here](https://gist.github.com/MichaelPaulukonis/24b0b2bc77e546647784).\r\n\r\nAnd an extract:\r\n\r\n```\r\nThere came a king who had seven sons, and when the other six went off\r\nto find brides, he kept the youngest with him because he could not\r\nbear to be parted from them all. They were supposed to bring back a\r\nbride for him, as well, but they found a king with six daughters and\r\nwooed them, forgetting their brother. But when they returned, they\r\npassed too close to a woodchuck-mouse's castle, and he turned them\r\nall, both princes and princesses, to stone in a fit of rage.\r\n\r\nWhen they did not return, the king, their father, tried to prevent\r\ntheir brother from following, but he went.\r\n\r\nOn the way, he helped a Pegasus-mustang, he helped a otter-Centaur, he\r\nhelped a enthusiastic monkey, he helped a lynx-newt, he helped a\r\ncow-hippopotamus, he helped a rat-Imp, he helped a ox-dingo, and gave\r\na starving mole-Pegasus his horse to eat. The mole-Pegasus let the\r\nprince ride on him, instead, and showed him the woodchuck-mouse's\r\ncastle, telling him to go inside. The prince was reluctant fearing the\r\nwrath of the woodchuck-mouse, but the mole-Pegasus consoled him. The\r\nmole-Pegasus persuaded the prince to enter the castle for there he\r\nwould encounter not the woodchuck-mouse, but the princess the\r\nwoodchuck-mouse kept prisoner.\r\n\r\nThe princess was very beautiful and the prince wanted to know how he\r\ncould kill the woodchuck-mouse and set her and his family free. The\r\nprincess said that there was no way, as the woodchuck-mouse did not\r\nkeep his heart in his body and therefore could not be killed. When the\r\nwoodchuck-mouse returned, the princess hid the prince, and asked the\r\nwoodchuck-mouse where he kept his heart. He told her that it was under\r\nthe door sill. The prince and princess dug there the next day and\r\nfound no heart. The princess strewed flowers over the door sill, and\r\nwhen the woodchuck-mouse returned, told him that it was because his\r\nheart lay there. The woodchuck-mouse admitted it wasn't there and told\r\nher it was in the cupboard. As before, the princess and the prince\r\nsearched, to no avail; once again, the princess strewed garlands of\r\nflowers on the cupboard and told the woodchuck-mouse it was because\r\nhis heart was there. Thereupon the woodchuck-mouse revealed to her\r\nthat, in fact, there was a malodours woods with a whale-cheetah,\r\nbeyond that there was a daunting glacier foreland with a suspicious\r\nllama, beyond that there was a vast and favorable terracettes with a\r\nibex-dog, beyond that there was a vast and favorable rapid with a\r\nrepugnant gorilla, beyond that there was a daunting oceanic plateau\r\nwith a marmoset-Succubus, beyond that there was a stinky plunge pool\r\nwith a Siren-mustang, beyond that there was a moderately-sized complex\r\ncrater with a unfriendly hog, beyond that there was a gross but not\r\naltogether repulsive delta with a ape-koala, and in the ape-koala's\r\nnest was an egg; and in the egg was the woodchuck-mouse's heart.\r\n\r\nThe prince rode to the malodours woods, where he was menaced by a\r\nwhale-cheetah. The prince called on the Pegasus-mustang to defeat the\r\nwhale-cheetah. The Pegasus-mustang defeated the whale-cheetah by using\r\nits Water Veil. The prince rode on to the daunting glacier foreland,\r\nwhere he was menaced by a suspicious llama. The prince called on the\r\notter-Centaur to defeat the suspicious llama. The otter-Centaur\r\ndefeated the suspicious llama by using its Wetland Adaptation. The\r\nprince rode to the vast and favorable terracettes, where he was\r\nmenaced by a ibex-dog. The prince called on the enthusiastic monkey to\r\ndefeat the ibex-dog. The enthusiastic monkey defeated the ibex-dog by\r\nusing its Fish Manipulation. The prince rode to the vast and favorable\r\nrapid, where he was menaced by a repugnant gorilla. The prince called\r\non the lynx-newt to defeat the repugnant gorilla. The lynx-newt\r\ndefeated the repugnant gorilla by using its Magic Bounce. The prince\r\nrode to the daunting oceanic plateau, where he was menaced by a\r\nmarmoset-Succubus. The prince called on the cow-hippopotamus to defeat\r\nthe marmoset-Succubus. The cow-hippopotamus defeated the\r\nmarmoset-Succubus by using its Norse Deity Physiology. The prince rode\r\nto the stinky plunge pool, where he was menaced by a Siren-mustang.\r\nThe prince called on the rat-Imp to defeat the Siren-mustang. The\r\nrat-Imp defeated the Siren-mustang by using its Night Vision. The\r\nprince rode to the moderately-sized complex crater, where he was\r\nmenaced by a unfriendly hog. The prince called on the ox-dingo to\r\ndefeat the unfriendly hog. The ox-dingo defeated the unfriendly hog by\r\nusing its White Smoke. The prince rode to the gross but not altogether\r\nrepulsive delta, where he was menaced by a ape-koala. The prince\r\ncalled on the mole-Pegasus to defeat the ape-koala. The mole-Pegasus\r\ndefeated the ape-koala by using its Sonic Scream. The mole-Pegasus\r\nplucked the egg from the nest of the ape-koala, gave it to the prince,\r\nand told him to squeeze it. When he did, the woodchuck-mouse screamed.\r\nThe mole-Pegasus told him to squeeze it again, and the woodchuck-mouse\r\npromised anything if he would spare his life. The prince told him to\r\nchange his brothers and their brides back to life, and the\r\nwoodchuck-mouse did so. Then the prince squeezed the egg into two and\r\nwent home with the woodchuck-mouse's captive princess as his bride;\r\naccompanying him were his brothers and their brides, and the king\r\nrejoiced.\r\n\r\nEventually, the prince, who lived a long an happy life, found his\r\nhappiness slipping from his fingers. In time, his heart became\r\nhardened, his rule became corrupt, and he became a stupid gila\r\nmonster.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere came a king who had seven sons, and when the other six went off\r\nto find brides, he kept the youngest with him because he could not\r\nbear to be parted from them all. They were supposed to bring back a\r\nbride for him, as well, but they found a king with six daughters and\r\nwooed them, forgetting their brother. But when they returned, they\r\npassed too close to a stupid gila monster's castle, and he turned them\r\nall, both princes and princesses, to stone in a fit of rage.\r\n\r\nWhen they did not return, the king, their father, tried to prevent\r\ntheir brother from following, but he went.\r\n\r\n[....]\r\n\r\n```"

Makes completely absurd contact info, staff names, etc. Creates a table of contents, index, glossary, etc.\r\n\r\n- section: catalog has many sections. some are like, columns advice news, others are like, little sqare cells advertising products or containing poems or comics or etc. Each section is given seed data by the catalog based on the whatever api theme thing is going on.. each \"section\" exports an array of perfectly size html divs that are a \"printed PDF page\"\r\n\r\n- cell: a section has many cells. might be text, image, comic, graph, idk. lotsa things. make like, dozens of these functions. idk, lil d3 charts, whatever. (BUT EVERYTHING should export to PDF and look reasonable)\r\n\r\nHELPERS\r\n\r\n- image grabber/processor: given a string, grab an image from the web, process it like gary in botALLY i.e, pick a few filters out of the hat and apply them with great strength, turn it B/W, and return a path to that image. Probably almost every cell will use this. Maybe sections should select a corpus of images for the cells to use.

        "body": "I should maybe qualify those statements a bit.\r\n\r\nI do think the goal I stated is highly unrealistic, certainly with the techniques that I'm personally prepared to use.  But the space of possible techniques is vast, so who knows?\r\n\r\nWhat I'm sort of getting at by choosing that goal is this:\r\n\r\nIn 2013, I tried generating a \"proper novel\". Last year, I did a bunch of experiments closer to the so-called \"conceptual writing\" side of things.  This year, I'm returning to the \"proper novel\", however quixotic any such attempt might be.\r\n\r\nGiven that I've stated a goal that I admit is unrealistic, I suppose I do not expect myself to actually achieve it.  But it will be interesting to see how I fail.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, one need not have only one goal, so...\r\n\r\nAfter last NaNoGenMo, around January of this year, I started thinking a lot about how people write stories.  I did a lot of research (if you can call reading article after article on TVTropes research) and I came to the conclusion that there are certainly some story-writing techniques that can be approximated with algorithms.\r\n\r\nSo, one of my secondary goals is: To implement one or more story-writing techniques that human writers use.\r\n\r\nThis is a much more realistic goal, I think.\r\n\r\nHeck, even The Swallows had a [MacGuffin](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin), but it wasn't really developed.  I'd like to go a bit beyond that.\r\n\r\nI'll probably continue to expand on these thoughts in future posts to this issue."

Trying to keep each post reasonably short.)\r\n\r\nIf the \"novel compiler\" doesn't take a written text as input, I suppose that raises the question of what it _does_ take as input.\r\n\r\nOne answer could be \"nothing, it's just a generator, you just run it,\" which might be literally true, but it doesn't really answer the question.\r\n\r\nA more satisfying answer would be that it takes an outline of a plot, in some kind of data format, as input, even if that outline is hardcoded or randomly generated in the compiler itself.\r\n\r\nIt then refines that plot by iteratively rewriting it, stepwise, into increasingly more detailed plots.  Once it has a detailed enough plot, it rewrites that into a series of events, and in the end rewrites those into sentences.  I suppose this is a top-down, plot-driven approach, as @TheCommieDuck described it.\r\n\r\nAbout these plots... (kind of thinking out loud here...)\r\n\r\nThe \"seed plot\" that the compiler starts with could be as skeletal as [The Hero's Journey](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHerosJourney).\r\n\r\nOr maybe even more basic, like, the \"null story\":\r\n\r\n> Once upon a time, they lived happily ever after. The end.\r\n\r\nFrom there, you just keep inserting subplots into it.  I'm still weighing ideas about exactly how to accomplish this process.  I might write more about it later."

It seems to work on multiple scales: Groking the central conceit in [Aggressive Passive](http://aaronareed.net/if/NaNoGenMo13/sample.html) or [Redwreath and Goldstar Have Traveled to Deathsgate](http://eblong.com/zarf/essays/r-and-g.html) takes a few minutes at most, which will give you the sense of the overall plot without reading it. (And then figuring out the puzzle of which question goes with which answer can take a lifetime.) \r\n\r\nSomething like #72 or [Alice's Adventures in the Whale](https://github.com/dariusk/NaNoGenMo/issues/69) takes a bit longer, because once you've grasped the pattern, the pleasure is in seeing the changes that were made in a familiar text.\r\n\r\nI suspect that simulations play by slightly different rules. Dwarf Fortress has certainly generated a lot of stories, though I'm not sure how many of them are interesting precisely because they were interactive. (Not to mention, most renditions are a retelling of the events, rather than a direct output.) I'm going to be watching this year's simulation results with interest.\r\n\r\nOne pleasure that most generative works lack is a sense that _an author intended them to happen this way_. Not that you can't get a degree of intention-sense. I suspect that's why high-concept things like Aggressive Passive work so well: we can read the higher authorial intent, and that makes it easier to get closure and catharsis."

Witness Sam Raimi - he did _Evil Dead_ not for any particular love of the genre, but for most-likely return on investment (time+money) ([a source](http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/30/sam-raimi-gives-us-an-evil-dead-history-lesson?page=2)). The audience tends to eat it up no matter how low the quality. Witness the large numbers of self-published zombie books on Amazon. Or romance novels of any of the vast, arcane genotypes of romance.\r\n\r\nSo - generated horror fiction. SplatterGenPunk. Note to self -- add this to #14"

        "body": "Just a quick update. I've set up <a href=\"https://github.com/zachwhalen/secretgardens/\">a repository</a> but I'm going back and forth about what I actually want to do. My first idea was to use this password dump to generate a novel that already exists, Pierre Menard-style. \r\n\r\nSo in my first version, the script scans the password dump for correctly-spelled English words, then looks for those words in the novel, *The Secret Garden*. Or rather, it scans *The Secret Garden*, and for each word it finds in the passwordlist, it prints that word. Words it fails to find are just printed as *****:\r\n\r\n> **** Mary ****** was sent to ************* Manor to live with her ****** \r\neverybody said she was the most ******************** child ever ***** \r\nIt was true too  She had a little thin face and a little thin ***** \r\nthin light hair and a sour expression  Her hair was yellow and **** \r\nface was yellow because she had been born in India and had always ***** \r\nill in one way or another  Her father had held a position under **** \r\nEnglish ********** and had always been busy and ill himself and **** \r\nmother had been a great beauty who ***** only to go to parties **** \r\namuse herself with gay people  She had not wanted a little girl *** \r\nall and when Mary was born she handed her over to the care of an ***** \r\nwho was made to understand that if she wished to please the *** ****** \r\nshe must keep the child out of sight as much as possible  So when **** \r\nwas a sickly ******* ugly little baby she was kept out of the **** \r\nand when she became a sickly ******* ******** thing she was kept **** \r\nof the way also  She never ********** seeing ********** anything **** \r\nthe dark faces of her **** and the other native servants and as ***** \r\nalways obeyed her and gave her her own way in everything because **** \r\n*** ***** would be angry if she was disturbed by her crying by **** \r\ntime she was six years old she was as ********** and selfish a ******* \r\npig as ever lived  The young English governess who came to teach **** \r\nto read and write ******** her so much that she gave up her place *** \r\nthree months and when other *********** came to try to fill it ***** \r\nalways went away in a shorter time than the first one  So if Mary **** \r\nnot chosen to really want to know how to read books she would ****** \r\nhave learned her letters at **** \r\n\r\nThis is interesting, to me at least, because each word you see here is something that someone used as a password. I can't decide, though, if it's *interesting enough*, so I'm trying to learn how to use POS tagging to do some smarter parsing. I'm thinking perhaps of replacing parts of speech with the frequency matching. Like, replace the most frequently used noun in the book with the most frequently used noun password (that is, \"password\"). \r\n"

I might try to find Don Quixote hidden within the library of Babel.\r\n\r\nThe simplest implementation of this would be to sanitize the Quixote so that it only contained `[a-z ,.]` then break it into 80-character 40-line pages, and search for each page using the library's fantastic search function. There are ~2,000,000 characters in the novel, so that would only be ~1000 pages. In that case, my 'novel' would probably just be the list of hex locations of the pages.\r\n\r\nI don't know if I'd like this as _the_ NaNoGenMo submission. I may like it as _a_ NaNoGenMo submission."

You could collect relevant tweets and manipulate or sort them in some way.\r\n\r\n[Here's](https://archive.org/details/fergusoncrawl&tab=about) an archive 13 million \"tweets that mention Ferguson, Missouri between August 10th and August 27th, 2014 subsequent to the death of Michael Brown\". It's actually just the IDs, but you can use [twarc](https://github.com/edsu/twarc) (the tool that collected them) to \"rehydrate\" them to full tweet data. More about this archive [here](http://inkdroid.org/2014/08/30/a-ferguson-twitter-archive/) which also mentions an Aaron Swartz tweet archive, and there's quite possibly more archives over [here](https://github.com/edsu?tab=repositories).\r\n\r\n"

Useful for improving reproducibility.\r\n\r\nThey all require Python 2.x (tested on Python 2.7.6 but will probably still work on some earlier versions) but only seedbank requires that you write your script in Python - the other two can be used as stand-alone tools.\r\n\r\nThey're all in the public domain, as is all the stuff in the NaNoGenLab.  So, please steal, fold, spindle, and mutilate as you see fit."

        "body": "@enkiv2 suggested that a short introduction to some historical techniques might be useful in the resources thread to point out possible approaches for people who might not be familiar with some of the precedents of text generation. So I thought I'd write about a few of them.\r\n\r\n[Dada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dada) incorporated several techniques that involved randomly assembling prior texts into new poetry. [The cut-up technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cut-up_technique) takes an existing text, cuts it to pieces, and then reassembles the bits in a new order. [This list of Surrealist techniques](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surrealist_techniques) might also be inspirational.\r\n\r\n[Oulipo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oulipo) is a group of writers who use [constraints](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constrained_writing) to define their writing. Relevant examples include [Queneau's _Cent Mille Milliards de Poèmes_ (A Hundred Thousand Billion Poems)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred_Thousand_Billion_Poems), which combines ten-line sonnets line-by-line; [Perec's _Life a User's Manual_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_a_User%27s_Manual), which is structured like a knight's tour of a chessboard; [Queneau's _Excercises in Style_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exercises_in_Style), 99 retellings of the same story; [Calvino's _The Castle of Crossed Destinies_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Castle_of_Crossed_Destinies), stories interperted via Tarot cards; and [Queneau's \"A Story as You Like It\"](http://www.thing.de/projekte/7:9%23/queneau_1.html).\r\n\r\nEven where they aren't directly generative, the approaches used by Oulipo writers often point to alternative forms a novel can take. For example, Calvino's [_Invisible Cities_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invisible_Cities) and [_If on a winter's night a traveler_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/If_on_a_winter%27s_night_a_traveler).\r\n\r\nOulipo is also significant because many of its members wrote about systems for generating stories and about incorporating computers into writing. Italio Calvino's essay \"Prose and Anticombinatorics,\" about using the computer to to find the constraints for a murder mystery; Paul Fournel's \"Computer and Writer: The Centre Pompidou Experiment\"; and Claude Berge's \"For a Potential Analysis of Combinatory Literature\" are particularly relevant.\r\n\r\nLastly, Jorges Luis Borges tends to crop up a lot, particularly for his short stories: \"The Library of Babel\", \"The Book of Sand\", \"An Examination of the Work of Herbert Quain\", \"The Garden of Forking Paths\", \"Pierre Menard, Author of the Quixote\", and \"Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius\"."
