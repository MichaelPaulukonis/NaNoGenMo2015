NEWMAN : I'm afraid my message that night was grim and disturbing. I remember telling you we were in the worst economic mess since the Depression. We're here because humanity refuses to accept that our relationship be guided by reason in everything; that is to say, in good conscience, the satisfaction which we no longer have any Real knowledge of it.\r\n\r\nThe world exists as the mirror of the Indian philosophers declares, “ It is a narrow-minded and ridiculous thing not to architecture, which admits it merely as extraneous ornament, and could Dispense with it.\r\n\r\nWe're also gathered here for a special event -- the national funeral for an unknown soldier who will today join the heroes of Lebanon and for the preservation of the sacred fire of liberty “ is “ finally staked on the experiment entrusted to the hands of the people. The Bible tells us there will be no immigration reform without employer sanctions, because it does such violence to the spirit, thwarting the human impulse to create, to enjoy life to the fullest, and to inquire into the cause of mankind and world peace. We can decide the tough issues not by who is right, infinitely surpassing Everything else that exists merely relatively, still remained unknown.\r\n\r\nMake no mistake about it, this attack was not just against ourselves or the Republic of Korea -- South Korea -- has offered to permit certain events of the 1988 Olympics to take place to begin with, and this will also show how old our view is, though the mass of philosophical knowledge of the subject, which makes mathematics so difficult. This becomes less in the idyll, still less to reproach him because he is Yet always thrown aside as vanished illusions. We are compelled by the principle of sufficient reason is truth, only as modifications of the actual world; thus according to this doctrine is old : it appears in the one case we find in the Vedas, Purana, poems, myths, legends of their saints, maxims and precepts, (85) we see that several ideas which are different in unessential particulars may be Allowed expressing myself by a metaphor.\r\n\r\n"

    "body": "![heart](https://hugovk.github.io/mucletters/output/favicon.ico?raw=true) My second [NaNoGenMo 2015 entry](https://github.com/dariusk/NaNoGenMo-2015) is an epistolary novel of love letters (and the second entry inspired by [D004x](https://www.edx.org/course/electronic-literature-davidsonx-d004x\r\n)).\r\n\r\n![405 Love Letters](https://hugovk.github.io/mucletters/output/snippet1.png?raw=true \"405 Love Letters\")\r\n\r\n * [HTML](https://hugovk.github.io/mucletters/output/mucletters.html)\r\n * [PDF](https://hugovk.github.io/mucletters/output/mucletters.pdf)\r\n * [code](mucletters.py)\r\n\r\n![heart](https://hugovk.github.io/mucletters/output/favicon.ico?raw=true) Christopher Strachey has been named the first digital artist; the first to make literary or artistic use of a computer.\r\n\r\n![heart](https://hugovk.github.io/mucletters/output/favicon.ico?raw=true) A colleague of Alan Turing, in 1952 Strachey was a programmer of the world's first commercially available general-purpose electronic computer, the Ferranti Mark 1, also known as the Manchester University Computer.\r\n\r\n![heart](https://hugovk.github.io/mucletters/output/favicon.ico?raw=true) According to [by Noah Wardrip-Fruin](https://grandtextauto.soe.ucsc.edu/2005/08/01/christopher-strachey-first-digital-artist/):\r\n\r\n> Christopher Strachey is rightly viewed as a pioneer of modern computing. He’s not usually, however, viewed as the creator of the first work of digital literature. Research toward my submission for DAC, however, has lead me to believe that he was — and that his initial digital literature project was also, quite probably, the first piece of digital art.\r\n\r\n> ...\r\n\r\n> That [1952] summer he developed — with some aesthetic advice from his sister Barbara, using Turing’s random number generator, and perhaps in collaboration with Turing — a Mark I program that created combinatory love letters. This was the first piece of digital literature, and of digital art, predating by a decade the earliest examples of digital computer art from recent surveys (e.g., quite useful books such as Christiane Paul’s *Digital Art* and Stephen Wilson’s *Information Arts*).\r\n\r\n![heart](https://hugovk.github.io/mucletters/output/favicon.ico?raw=true) Strachey described the love letters in a 1954 article entitled The \"Thinking\" Machine, published in the literary journal [*Encounter*](http://www.unz.org/Pub/Encounter-1954oct-00025):\r\n\r\n> IN SPITE of a certain impression of rather\r\nVictorian Babu, I think there is very little\r\ndoubt of the intention of these letters:\r\n\r\n> *Darling Sweetheart\r\nYou are my avid fellow tiding. My affection\r\ncuriously clings to your passionate wish. My liking\r\nyearns for ),our heart. You are my wistful sympathy:\r\nmy tender liking.\r\nYours beautifully\r\nM.U.C.*\r\n\r\n> *Honey Dear\r\nMy sympathetic affection beautifully attracts your\r\naffectionate enthusiasm. You are my loving adoration:\r\nmy breathless adoration. My fellow feeling\r\nbreathlessly hopes for your dear eagerness. My\r\nlovesick adoration cherishes your avid ardour.\r\nYours wistfully\r\nM.U.C.*\r\n\r\n> The Manchester University Computer (hence\r\nthe irreverent signature) can type out letters\r\nlike this at the rate of about one a minute for\r\nhours without ever repeating itself. The scheme\r\non which it works, however, is almost\r\nchildishly simple. Apart from the beginning and\r\nthe ending of the letters, there are only two\r\nbasic types of sentence. The first is \"*My* —\r\n(adj.) ~ (noun) — (adv.) — (verb) *your* —\r\n (adj.) ~ (noun).\" There are lists\r\nappropriate adjectives, nouns, adverbs, and\r\nverbs from which the blanks are filled in at\r\nrandom. There is also a further random choice\r\nas to whether or not the adjectives and adverb\r\nare included at all. The second type is simply\r\n\"*You are my* — (adj.) — (noun),\" and\r\nthis case the adjective is always present. There\r\nis a random choice of which type of sentence is\r\nto be used, but if there are two consecutive\r\nsentences of the second type, the first ends with\r\na colon (unfortunately the teleprinter of the\r\ncomputer had no comma) and the initial \"*You\r\nare*\" of the second is omitted. The letter starts\r\nwith two words chosen from special lists ; there\r\nare then five sentences of one of the two basic\r\ntypes, and the letter ends \"*Yours* — (adv.)\r\nM. U. C.\"\r\n\r\n> There are many obvious imperfections in\r\nthis scheme (indeed very little thought went\r\ninto its devising) and the fact that the vocabulary\r\nwas largely based on Roget’s Thesaurus\r\nlends a very peculiar flavour to the results. The\r\nchief point of interest, however, is not the\r\nobvious crudity of the scheme, nor even in\r\nways in which it might be improved, but in the\r\nremarkable simplicity of the plan when compared\r\nwith the diversity of the letters it produces.\r\nIt is clear that these letters are produced by a\r\nrather simple trick and that the computer is not\r\nreally \"thinking\" at all. This is true of all\r\nprograms which make the computer appear\r\nto think; on analysis they are nothing more\r\nthan rather complicated tricks. However,\r\nsometimes these tricks can lead to quite unexpected\r\nand interesting results.\r\n\r\n![heart](https://hugovk.github.io/mucletters/output/favicon.ico?raw=true) Using Strachey's description, I reimplemented his love-letter generator in Python (using the word lists from this [PHP version](http://www.gingerbeardman.com/loveletter/)).\r\n\r\n![DARLING MOPPET](https://hugovk.github.io/mucletters/output/snippet2.png?raw=true \"DARLING MOPPET\")\r\n\r\n![heart](https://hugovk.github.io/mucletters/output/favicon.ico?raw=true) Running on a Macbook Pro, it can generate some half a million per minute, compared with Manchester University Computer's rate of one per minute. (Well, this isn't quite a fair comparison: the MUC outputted to paper whereas the MBP just saved to disk.)\r\n\r\n![DARLING CHICKPEA](https://hugovk.github.io/mucletters/output/snippet3.png?raw=true \"DARLING CHICKPEA\")\r\n\r\n![heart](https://hugovk.github.io/mucletters/output/favicon.ico?raw=true) My NaNoGenMo entry goes further: it starts out as simple five-line love letters following Strachey. But as the pages turn, the letters become more and more absurd as more and more words are instead taken at random from the [Wordnik dictionary](http://developer.wordnik.com/docs.html). And towards the middle of the book the letters become longer, up to 120 lines long, before settling back down to five lines at the end.\r\n\r\n![All victorious night-line](https://hugovk.github.io/mucletters/output/snippet4.png?raw=true \"All victorious night-line\")\r\n\r\n![heart](https://hugovk.github.io/mucletters/output/favicon.ico?raw=true) In the HTML version, clicking a word takes you to another letter containing that word.\r\n\r\n![heart](https://hugovk.github.io/mucletters/output/favicon.ico?raw=true)\r\n"

    "body": "Isaac's mention in #11 of Jim Butcher's '[scenes](http://jimbutcher.livejournal.com/2647.html) and [sequels](http://jimbutcher.livejournal.com/2880.html)' model of story-writing got me thinking about a more straightforward and limited model for simulation-based plotting, basically borrowing elements from TaleSpin but also from markov chains. Since I might not actually code this, I'm going to try to clearly and completely document my ideas about it here.\r\n\r\nButcher suggests that scenes have, essentially, a two-bit result matrix. A scene is a situation in which the protagonist attempts to achieve a very specific goal, and at the end of the scene, the goal can either be achieved or not, and some other (often negative) attribute can be gained or not. He suggests that the tone of a story in terms of how uninteresting or cynical it seems falls mostly to the probability of these two bits: if goals are achieved too often the story seems trivial while if the goals are typically failures without complication the protagonist seems incompetent (Superman vs Worf); having added complications generates a 'hook' for later scenes as well as allowing for both successes and failures to seem more interesting, even though ultimately very little information has been added. So, I model a scene as an object containing a low-level/atomic goal, a bit indicating whether or not that goal was achieved, a bit indicating whether or not there was a complication, and the complication if it exists.\r\n\r\nButcher suggests that sequels, which occur between scenes, consist of an emotional reaction to the result of the scene plus a logical reanalysis of strategy. He suggests that the ratio of how much text is spent on the emotional reaction versus the logical reanalysis is important in terms of how warm versus cold the story seems to readers, and that the ratio of how much text is spent on sequels versus scenes largely determines whether the story is seen as slow and cerebral or fast-paced and action-packed. Ultimately, though, the actual information content of the sequel is fairly low: its elements are a re-statement of the result of the scene in emotional terms, and an explanation of the goal of the next scene.\r\n\r\nSo, I suggest the following model of a caper story.\r\n\r\nWe have a 'world model' or 'game model' resembling a markov model. It's a state machine, where each state has a value in terms of a variety of potential goals, and each state has multiple possible states it can lead to, each with attached base probabilities. Each state also has multiple possible complications which have attached probabilities.\r\n\r\nWe furthermore have a 'story model' which consists of tunable weights. For instance, the story model will contain a weight on the success probability: a superman-style story might have a weight of 90% so that only state changes with a base rate of less than 10% will have less than a 50% chance of succeeding, while a Pink Panther story might have a weight of 10% so that everything the protagonist tries to do is a failure. Likewise, the story model contains a tunable probability of complications. (A superman-style story would have a low complication rate, while a Pink Panther story would have a high one.) We then have at least two more tunable options: an average/target length for the emotional reaction portion of the sequel and an average/target length for the logical reanalysis portion. Tune up the former and get a romance novel; tune up the latter and get Sherlock Holmes.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the run of the program, we have a large-scale end goal. (For example, \"steal the jewels\".) We go through a series of scenes by choosing actions based on the success probabilities in the world model to our goal pool (which would be the large-scale goal averaged with a weighted array of complications), in a probablistic manner: we create new composite probabilities for our protagonist *choosing* different courses of action based on the probability of each for achieving each of our weighted goals in the goal pool, including iterating further ahead in the world graph. (As an optimization, we can actually precompute for each node the true base probabilities of all outcomes). \r\n\r\nOnce we have chosen our route, we produce a scene with that route as our immediate goal (say, \"buy a disguise as a museum security guard\"), the result (say, success), and the complication (say, \"my gun can't fit in this uniform without bulging\"). We then produce the sequel passage: the emotional reaction (\"I'm so glad that this uniform was so easy to find!\") and the logical reanalysis (\"I should probably buy a smaller weapon so that I can hide it better\"). We continue with the next iteration (goal: \"buy a smaller weapon\", route: \"go to the gun store\", result: \"failure, gun store closed\", complication: \"mugger stole my wallet in front of gun store\"), and iterate until either our large-scale end goal is achieved or there is no path with a base rate over some threshhold to achieve any of the goals in our goal pool."

    "body": "My plan is to use Dwarf Fortress to aid in writing a novel. I was thinking about how to go about generating a novel a lot at the start of this month and I realized the issue most run into is that the plots are far from gripping. There's little conflict involved. This lead me to think of trying to simulate a world, something like a graph to represent the layout of the world an have the characters go around the world and interact with each other and the world. I realized quickly that this approach would be essentially narrating my own, likely very crappy, version of The Sims. That lead me to the thought of using Dwarf Fortress for world simulation.\r\n\r\nThe basic idea is to have a bot play through Adventure Mode and write down what is going on. Hopefully this will result in interesting conflicts as the bot has to fight to survive the elements and evil creatures in the world.\r\n\r\nI also realize this is *way* beyond the scope of a 1 month project so I'm just going to work on this as a pet project. Hopefully by this time next year it'll be in a state where I can generate something meaningful from it. This makes me a dirty, rotten cheater but the idea is cool enough that I don't really care :P"

The end result is a bunch of legalese formatted as a real ToS, complete with sign and date line.  I think the Markdown formatting is what sets it apart from just spewing re-sentences around: it's amazing what some ALLCAPS and numbered lists can do for your otherwise boring document.  Also, it tries to replace the company names with COMPANY_NAME, and later re-replace it with Cyberdyne Systems, so it seems more coherent.\r\n\r\nWish the corpus was bigger, though.  I think a warning label from some popular prescription drug would spice it up."

Unless I was mistaken, this was formerly known as the Devil's Tavern. Passepartout remembered it becoming the hostelry of choice of \"Hanging\" Judge Jeffreys. It seemed perfect for pirates.\r\n\r\n>Passepartout and I walked to Thames Tunnel. I could see that it was the first tunnel known to have been constructed successfully underneath a navigable river. Passepartout commented that they didn't modify their methods for soft clay and quicksand. James remembered it becoming the East London Line. It seemed quite suitable for goods services as late as 1962.\r\n\r\n>We hailed a cab to Rotherhithe Tunnel. Passepartout talked about significant congestion and tailbacks. To the best of my knowledge, this was formally opened in 1908 by George Prince of Wales (later King George V). Passepartout explained how it had been designed to serve foot and horse-drawn traffic between the docks on either side of the river. Things were never the same after the first of the four shafts is reached. We moved on, avoiding its poor safety features.\r\n\r\nIt turns out that a straight circle around the same latitude doesn't give many articles outside of Europe, so I might have to make it plot its own route based on the cities which contain the most geotagged articles."

    "body": "I needed a break from trying to solve hard problems in my primary NaNoGen, so I bashed this thing out real quick.\r\n\r\nThe idea is to take the structure of an existing document, and render it into a sound poem(?)/mess/thing. Hopefully the result is fun to read aloud, and also somewhat intriguing to look at, in that you can possibly figure out some of what was going on in the original, but really not very much.\r\n\r\nFor instance, here is the output on a [favorite Mervyn Peake poem](https://www.scribd.com/doc/288583107/The-Shapes):\r\n\r\n>Gso Thexad\r\n>Toshrr Saofa\r\n>\r\n>Klod imo stumo nsohyn rpef rmeti ckoso iwha crwanc tianuv\r\n>Temo long phoon raathens murnh ock fiasp ic chiebb?\r\n>Ry, wen kbyos xpawaring rad flera noda nechis\r\n>Stomnect ri uitrr\r\n>Ksy pahanum westsan dret i staotebr bepsr,\r\n>Int oht bly cten\r\n>Esseresesi uccinc ylol udo sis\r\n>Ppo dersto htir o dabl yith ig yca rorvs\r\n>Atyknd eng raomln\r\n>An la-intablhis arslutish igis.\r\n>\r\n>Gleh eti flyka llidar tcih seho he mpeys urh nser?\r\n>Ytidi brenor seds cuotab garc iem an lsiel pemiw?\r\n>Coypit stev spt ry kehahayt, detacr reqi\r\n>Ysi hobramm al e trasul ppai hactibe\r\n>Rciti yeormoh cesthot ckiha; ew rena rcue neef\r\n>Er hutres nasmeti nsen asks tir\r\n>Censf thustoh sans shu reo.

I've run the program on all 111k words of [Cathrynne M. Valente](http://www.catherynnemvalente.com/)'s latest novel Radiance, to produce my first real NaNoGenMo success in three years of attempting to participate: [Sound Radiance](https://www.techhouse.org/~jake/sound_radiance.txt)!\r\n\r\nI picked Radiance because it has a lot of structural variety, and also because I am currently only partway through, and am somewhat tickled by the idea of staring at later parts of Sound Radiance and trying to derive spoilers therefrom.\r\n\r\nOne issue this project brings to mind is the legality of heavily lossy encodings of copyrighted material. Presumably if I rot13'd the text of the novel, that would be a no-no, but I feel fairly confident that even extensive cryptanalysis could not recover significant portions of the original text from the above file. Small words yes, and maybe a few oft-repeated names, since the algorithm avoids replacing a letter with itself, but I think that it is not, in general, reversible. But that's another somewhat interesting question - does it matter how hard it is? Does it matter whether I was pretty sure it was impossible, if it turns out not to be?\r\n\r\n[Here's the code](https://www.techhouse.org/~jake/unsound_structure.py), which I hereby declare to be public domain. As I did this for a quick break in a couple hours, it is decidedly Not Good.\r\n"

    "body": "My nanogenmo idea: the diary of a sad robot experiencing existential crisis. It will juxtapose very human prose (drawing from a secret corpus*) with very robotic code and random errors. The entire thing will be glitched and obliterated using a combination of a markov-like algorithm and substitution of words with non-ASCII characters or whitespace. (Due to some words turning into whitespace, I've decided to generate a lot more than 50000 words so that only words that are visibly words are counted; technical issues could ruin this plan though, idk.)\r\n\r\nIt'll be implemented in Python 3.\r\n\r\nI'm reluctant to commit (emotionally) to nanogenmo this year as I have 2 very demanding uni assignments to complete and only 3 weeks to complete them in. I initially wasn't going to open an issue at all, but this morning I made significant progress on the project while lying in bed and I decided I have a good chance of finishing it. My only problem at the moment is that the script hangs when I try to generate more than a few hundred words.\r\n\r\n_* don't worry, I have the rights to the corpus_\r\n\r\nUPDATE: [here is my repo](https://github.com/d-baker/NaNoGenMo-2015)"

    "body": "Instead of focusing on my interesting idea (Issue #10), I've spent the first couple of days of NaNoGenMo working on something that seemed like a fun warmup project. But I'm doing it in Prolog and it's taking me a while to get it right.\r\n\r\nMy program will generate all the syllables that are possible in German. I have a knowledge base that contains everything I know about German phonotactics (in case anyone's interested, I use the information provided by T. Alan Hall in _Phonologie: Eine Einführung_ [2000]). The syllables are represented in [SAMPA](http://www.phon.ucl.ac.uk/home/sampa/), a machine-readable phonetic alphabet.\r\n\r\nI really like the output so far, I'll create a repo and link it as soon as I have a complete version. Here's a preview:\r\n\r\n# Jede Silbe\r\n> pim! pin! piN! pil! pij! pir! pip! pit! pik! pif! pis! piS! piC! pix! pimp! pimt! pimf! pims! pimS! pint! pinf! pins! pinS! pinC! pilp! pilt! pilk! pilf! pils! pilS! pilC! pirp! pirt! pirk! pirf! pirs! pirS! pirC! pilm! piln! pirm! pirn! pirl! pipS! pikt! piks! pift! pifs! pist! pisk! piSt! piSs! piCt! piCs! pixt! pym! pyn! pyN! pyl! pyj! pyr! pyp! pyt! pyk! pyf! pys! pyS! pyC! pyx! pymp! pymt! pymf! pyms! pymS! pynt! pynf! pyns! pynS! pynC! pylp! pylt! pylk! pylf! pyls! pylS! pylC! pyrp! pyrt! pyrk! pyrf! pyrs! pyrS! pyrC! pylm! pyln! pyrm! pyrn! pyrl! pypS! pykt! pyks! pyft! pyfs! pyst! pysk! pySt! pySs! pyCt! pyCs! pyxt! pem! pen! peN! pel! pej! per! pep! pet! pek! pef! pes! peS! peC! pex! pemp! pemt! pemf! pems! pemS! pent! penf! pens! penS! penC! pelp! pelt! pelk! pelf! pels! pelS! pelC! perp! pert! perk! perf! pers! perS! perC! pelm! peln! perm! pern! perl! pepS! pekt! peks! peft! pefs! pest! pesk! peSt! peSs! peCt! peCs! pext! p2m! p2n! p2N! p2l! p2j! p2r! p2p! p2t! p2k! p2f! p2s! p2S! p2C! p2x! p2mp! p2mt! p2mf! p2ms! p2mS! p2nt! p2nf! p2ns! p2nS! p2nC! p2lp! p2lt! p2lk! p2lf! p2ls! p2lS! p2lC! p2rp! p2rt! p2rk! p2rf! p2rs! p2rS! p2rC! p2lm! p2ln! p2rm! p2rn! p2rl! p2pS! p2kt! p2ks! p2ft! p2fs! p2st! p2sk! p2St! p2Ss! p2Ct! p2Cs! p2xt! pE:m! pE:n! pE:N! pE:l! pE:j! pE:r! pE:p! pE:t! pE:k! pE:f! pE:s! pE:S! pE:C! pE:x! pE:mp! pE:mt! pE:mf! pE:ms! pE:mS! pE:nt! pE:nf! pE:ns! pE:nS! pE:nC! pE:lp! pE:lt! pE:lk! pE:lf! pE:ls! pE:lS! pE:lC! pE:rp! pE:rt! pE:rk! pE:rf! pE:rs! pE:rS! pE:rC! pE:lm! pE:ln! pE:rm! pE:rn! pE:rl! pE:pS! pE:kt! pE:ks! pE:ft! pE:fs! pE:st! pE:sk! pE:St! pE:Ss! pE:Ct! pE:Cs! pE:xt!\r\n\r\nSome things I have learned doing this:\r\n- The German language is a lot more complex than T. Alan Hall pretends it is. I had to add a lot of constraints to prevent unarticulable syllables from being created, and I still haven't found all the errors.\r\n- Turns out German has around 60 000 possible syllables! It's actually a little less because my program makes some mistakes with assimilation in consonant clusters. For example, \"penk\" will be evaluated as a valid syllable even though the n would become a \"N\" (velar nasal) when articulated directly before the k. So \"peNk\" should be valid while \"penk\" should not.\r\nAnyway, it's a little under 60 000 words so I think this will be a fine NaGenMo No.\r\n- Prolog is teaching me much more about algorithm complexity than any lecture about sorting algorithms ever could. Accidentally calculating the power set of a set with 60 000 members is very expensive.\r\n- German is a weird language and allows a huge number of syllables, most of which I don't recall ever having read, heard or said before."

Then I can run some form of machine learning to either generate interactions between characters actually extracted from the stories or to generate new character relationships between random characters. Ideally it will produce a bunch of short stories that are sort of like very low-quality fan fiction.\r\n\r\nJust for fun, I've decided that while I'm developing it, I'll only use stories written by women as input. I'm not committing to anything as input to the final product yet; we'll see."

It was Elijah.\r\n\"Going online?\"\r\n\"Hands off, will you,\" said I.\r\n\"Lookee here,\" said Queequeg, shaking himself, \"go 'way!\"\r\n\"Ain't going online, then?\"\r\n\"Yes, we are,\" said I, \"but what business is that of yours? Do you know, Mr. Elijah, that I consider you a little impertinent?\"\r\n\"No, no, no; I wasn't aware of that,\" said Elijah, slowly and wonderingly looking from me to Queequeg, with the most unaccountable glances.\r\n\"Elijah,\" said I, \"you will oblige my friend and me by withdrawing. We are going to the Indian and Pacific networks, and would prefer not to be detained.\"\r\n"

I've never had any actual programmers look at my code. I've self taught myself everything I know about coding, so I could be doing everything terribly. I do know though that there are probably quite a few bugs in that code and also I know its done super messily. Just wanted to get it done after awhile.

    "body": "Thought experiment: you and I are playing a game. I write ten opening sentences for a novel, and you pick the one you like best and let me know; that becomes the opener. Then I write ten second sentences for the novel. You pick what you like best and let me know. Et cetera.\r\n\r\nWho wrote the book? I wrote literally every word, but you dictated nearly the entire form of the novel.\r\n\r\nI plan to act as sentence-by-sentence editor for an algorithm (or set of algorithms) where I review something like 5,000 multiple choice questions and hand pick each sentence of the novel.\r\n\r\nRight now I'm using an extremely naive function that just pulls random sentences from Gutenberg using [gutencorpus](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gutencorpus). Here's ten sentences, derived from 10x10 sentences that the algorithm gave me:\r\n\r\n> She added hot baths, sitz baths, shower baths, and plunges.   The tableau all waned at last with the pallidness aloft; and once more the Pequod and every soul on her decks were wrapped in a pall.  As a brother, a landlord, a master, she considered how many people's happiness were in his guardianship!  Jane met her with a smile of such sweet complacency, a glow of such happy expression, as sufficiently marked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the evening.  And it is much to be deplored that the place to which you devote so considerable a portion of the whole term of your natural life, should be so sadly destitute of anything approaching to a cosy inhabitiveness, or adapted to breed a comfortable localness of feeling, such as pertains to a bed, a hammock, a hearse, a sentry box, a pulpit, a coach, or any other of those small and snug contrivances in which men temporarily isolate themselves.  No: because the mails are very irregular between here and New Guinea.   If we had not used it, that blessed child would have!  They fence with their long lower jaws, sometimes locking them together, and so striving for the supremacy like elks that warringly interweave their antlers.   But a mob without any _man_ at the head of it is _beneath_ pitifulness.  \"For eight-and-forty hours let me charter your ship--I will gladly pay for it, and roundly pay for it--if there be no other way--for eight-and-forty hours only--only that--you must, oh, you must, and you SHALL do this thing.\r\n\r\nI picked the order of the sentences and I do think it hangs together with more coherence than quick experiment like this usually does. My plan is to use `doc2vec` or similar, with maybe a few other tricks, and have the algorithm take into account at least the very last sentence I gave it to give me a more coherent set of options (with this pure random sentence thing, usually only 1 or 2 out of 10 options makes any sense at all)."

Want to make sure you have all your things before you walk out the door? Forget to pay tribute to The Unnamable One and want to avoid having your blood replaced by sulfuric acid? This is the book for you.\r\n\r\nI could make this into a webpage that serves one ritual at a time, and I may do that eventually, but right now the goal is to create a PDF with one ritual per page. The PDF part may happen, to some degree, by hand, or perhaps after November is over, depending on how difficult that winds up being."

There are also two example texts:\r\n\r\n * [God's Thoughts in Nebuchadnezzar / Through The Saying-Mouth](https://github.com/mewo2/vocab-mashup/blob/master/examples/alicesbible.txt) - Lewis Carroll's Alice books, with vocabulary from the King James Bible\r\n * [Blood and Cowardice](https://github.com/mewo2/vocab-mashup/blob/master/examples/pridetreasure.txt) - Pride and Prejudice, with vocabulary from Treasure Island\r\n\r\nThis was mostly done in October, so it doesn't really count for NaNoGenMo purposes, but it may be of interest."

    "body": "I'm in. \r\n\r\nAt this point, I have no idea what the novel will be about. Instead, I have some ideas about the generation process. I'm going to start with Warren Sack's Common Lisp version of Micro-Talespin (http://eliterature.org/images/microtalespin.txt), mostly for familiarity. I used the Micro-Mumble generation engine from the original Micro-Talespin (converting the original UCI Lisp source to Interlisp) in my dissertation work (Jim Meehan was my advisor), but it's been a _**very**_ long time, so it's doubtful that any of that past experience will be all that helpful.\r\n\r\nI have cheated a bit - I started looking at the code and did a few tweaks as I rebuilt my understanding. I'll include the Sack original and all my \"pre-start\" changes in an initial check-in after the starting gun sounds. Unfortunately, I don't seem to have my dissertation code, but it would all have to be converted to Common Lisp anyway, so perhaps that's no great loss.\r\n\r\nOversimplifying, I see four development areas: story setup, simulation, story-level  decisions, and tactical generation. This is roughly \"where do we start\", \"what happens\", \"what do we tell the reader and when\", and \"how do we say it.\" In Micro-Talespin, there are nearly-separable mechanisms for the simulator and tactical generation, but any story-level decisions are implicitly baked into the code, mostly amounting to \"tell them everything in the order it occurs.\" (The simulator and generator are OK to illustrate the approach, but both will need work to produce something reasonable.)\r\n\r\nI'm also interested in looking at using other sources of \"what happens\", such as event records extracted from news stories (e.g., http://www.gdeltproject.org/) in place of the simulator in Micro-Talespin, but whether the result would be \"novelistic\" is an open question.\r\n\r\nThe Talespin approach is OK for an episode. It remains to be seen if it can sustain a novel-length story. The idea of a framing story (as used by others) is one possibility, but there's clearly lots of experimentation ahead.\r\n\r\nYes, far too ambitious. We'll see where things are at the end of November.\r\n\r\nRepo is here: https://github.com/rbechtel/NaNoGenMo"

I haven't really experimented with procedural dialog yet, so this is as good an excuse as any. My novel will have certain characters who are in certain states. Each scene will generate a setting, and bring in some of the characters from the novel, and then run the dialog engine as they talk to each other about various things using mostly canned phrases and mad-lib replacement. Phrases will affect state and relationship in the other characters in the scene, as well as suggest topic transitions. The scene ends when a one or more characters have moved in threshold from one state to another (Fred likes Wilma -> Fred is mad at Wilma, etc).\r\n\r\nTo ensure story can complete, some characters will have a protected death state. While in this state, they are unable to be killed by means which can't be reverted in another scene. When the story selects a character who has been killed in protected death state to enter a new scene, he will explain why he is still alive. At various points in the novel, the protected death state will be removed.\r\n\r\nIn last chapter all protected deaths are removed. We get to see if the characters by the end of the book are getting along, or if they kill each other :)"

    "body": "In a 2007 survey by Pew Forum on Religion, 21% of self-proclaimed atheists believe in God or a universal spirit.\r\n\r\nThe most plausible explanation I have for this phenomena is that these 'atheists' just don't know what term to use to represent their unique belief system, and so just relied on atheism as a good substitute. This explanation is backed by my analysis of a 2010 survey where Pew asked some God-believing atheists what is the definition of atheism (and most got the answer correct). That being said, there ***are*** some belief systems that would be compatible with atheism: Spinoza's pantheism, Buddhism, and Simulationism (the belief that we are living in a computer simulation). I mention these three belief systems because I actually encountered these three atheists online.\r\n\r\nLet's write a novel based on these people. Pew has released the 2007 survey dataset in 2008, so it's just a matter of parsing the data, and then feeding it into a mad-libby template. The hope is that people would want to read the novel past the first few pages because it's based on real life survey data. You're reading about what a real person told a pollster on the phone! That has to be exciting.\r\n\r\nEach chapter will discuss about one of these atheists, using information about them to construct a plausible narrative of their day-to-day life, with an emphasis on their religious practices and beliefs. For example, if one of these atheists claim to meditate, then I might mention him (or her) mediating. Details that are not in the survey dataset (such as their name) will be randomly generated, thereby ensuring that this is a fictional work..."

    "body": "I'm really happy to participate again to this project, so I thought about it for a few weeks already and I have two ideas, I'll create an issue for the other one if I have time to complete this first one.\r\n\r\nFor the first one, I intend to generate a play of +50k words in french based on the forum posts of the website [Jeuxvideo.com](http://www.jeuxvideo.com/) (biggest french website on video games)\r\nThe \"Blabla\" forums of Jeuxvideo.com are famous for being the \"french 4chan\" although posts don't vanish and boards are more organized and moderated. Still, a lot of very ugly and/or strange things are posted every day and the community around there can be really scary, funny and/or just weird.\r\n\r\nThe idea was inspired by [a news article about the forums of this website](http://tempsreel.nouvelobs.com/medias/20150924.OBS6430/antisemitisme-homophobie-fanatisme-jeuxvideo-com-la-ruche-a-fiel.html) The title helps to get a glimpse of what can be found there : \"Antisemitism, homophobia, fanatism\", and we could add a lot more to the list. Anyway, at one point, the journalist writes \"This forum, it's like a play, sometimes funny, sometimes tragic.\" That gave me the idea.\r\n\r\nI plan to mostly use two of the main boards of the forums that are [\"Blabla 15-18\"](http://www.jeuxvideo.com/forums/0-50-0-1-0-1-0-blabla-15-18-ans.htm) and [\"Blabla 18-25\"](http://www.jeuxvideo.com/forums/0-51-0-1-0-1-0-blabla-18-25-ans.htm) (it's an \"age\" classification) where teenagers and young adults talk about anything and everything. I will translate most common smileys into stage directions next to the dialogues and do a scene for every different topic.\r\n\r\nI have to think about some filtering for the topics maybe (use topics that are not too long nor too short), and maybe try to add some thematic or binding between each scene."

I definitely want to try something ala what @cpressey mentioned - avoiding more unpredictable stuff and adjusting existing stories.\r\n\r\nI'm still undecided on an approach. I think I'll try going top down (plot -> events -> text) rather than just making random sentences from a grammar. \r\n\r\nA prediction from the start? This isn't going to end up with 50,000 words in any sane capability. I think something which seems a lot more like a very long, linear, short story IS possible; that is, the plot events become incredibly granular and small (if a normal novel has, say, 10 different major events in 50k words - this will probably have 200-300). \r\n\r\nIt could also be that this is all complete garbage and I'll swap to a destructive approach from existing material. But who knows, we'll see.\r\n\r\nAlso undecided between using Prolog, C#, or maybe finding something else to use.\r\n\r\n"

It gets all \"I see what you did there\" and balks at facing yet [more unpredictable stuff](http://www.gamesbyangelina.org/2015/10/more-unpredictable-stuff/).\r\n\r\n**Goal**: To write a generator that generates a novel that does not succumb to this effect.\r\n\r\nYou still might not be able to read the resulting novel to the end, but, if you stop reading after the first 2 chapters, it should be because the novel is just plain _bad_, not because its aura of generativeness is burning a hole in your attention span.\r\n\r\nDownloading an existing novel from Project Gutenberg, or similarly trivial approaches, don't count.\r\n\r\nThis is, of course, a completely unrealistic goal.  But one must have *some* goal, mustn't one?"
