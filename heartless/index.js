 So. Plan of action
 THESE ARE ALL TO START THINGS OFF
 Main body of story is static
 call to function to get n-helpers
 helper includes helper, hero encounter-locale,
 helper ability, helper antagonist, antagonist method of defeat
 which may just come from ability, or should relate to it
 to begin, these will be stupidly static, with incremented numbers.
 concentrate on getting a dumb skeleton
 and, hey, maybe some tests, because that always trips you up
 when you least expect it and gee these don't really _need_ test do they?
 anyhow.
 Getting this "working" should help solidify the ideas of what properties
 the helper "object" should have.
 Then look into auto-generation of helpers and associated landscape
 the latter is an issu,e because we probably don't want 11 helpers in a row
 that are involved with crossing rivers or adjacent bodies of water.
 or maybe that's a secondary concern....
 I'm _thinking_ that some sort of knoweldge/rule system is required
 to deal with abilities, locales, antagonists, etc.
 but maybe it doesn't have to me even that smart.
 see 2014's example of ....
